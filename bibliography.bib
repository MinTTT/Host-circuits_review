  abstract = {Light has emerged as a control input for biological systems due to its precise spatiotemporal resolution. The limited toolset for light control in bacteria motivated us to develop a light-inducible transcription system that is independent from cellular regulation through the use of an orthogonal RNA polymerase. Here, we present our engineered blue light-responsive T7 RNA polymerases (Opto-T7RNAPs) that show properties such as low leakiness of gene expression in the dark state, high expression strength when induced with blue light, and an inducible range of more than 300-fold. Following optimization of the system to reduce expression variability, we created a variant that returns to the inactive dark state within minutes once the blue light is turned off. This allows for precise dynamic control of gene expression, which is a key aspect for most applications using optogenetic regulation. The regulators, which only require blue light from ordinary light-emitting diodes for induction, were developed and tested in the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a crucial cell factory for biotechnology due to its fast and inexpensive cultivation and well understood physiology and genetics. Opto-T7RNAP, with minor alterations, should be extendable to other bacterial species as well as eukaryotes such as mammalian cells and yeast in which the T7 RNA polymerase and the light-inducible Vivid regulator have been shown to be functional. We anticipate that our approach will expand the applicability of using light as an inducer for gene expression independent from cellular regulation and allow for a more reliable dynamic control of synthetic and natural gene networks.},

  abstract = {Genetic switches in which the activity of T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) is directly regulated by external signals are obtained with an engineering strategy of splitting the protein into fragments and using regulatory domains to modulate their reconstitutions. Robust switchable systems with excellent dark-off/light-on properties are obtained with the light-activatable VVD domain and its variants as regulatory domains. For the best split position found, working switches exploit either the light-induced interactions between the VVD domains or allosteric effects. The split fragments show high modularity when they are combined with different regulatory domains such as those with chemically inducible interaction, enabling chemically controlled switches. To summarize, the T7 RNA polymerase-based switches are powerful tools to implement light-activated gene expression in different contexts. Moreover, results about the studied split positions and domain organizations may facilitate future engineering studies on this and on related proteins.},

  abstract        = {Reducing leaky gene expression is critical for improving protein yield of recombinant bacteria and stability of engineered cellular circuits in synthetic biology. Leaky gene expression occurs when a genetic promoter is not fully repressed, leading to unintended protein synthesis in the absence of stimuli. Existing work have devised specific molecular strategies for reducing leaky gene expression of each promoter. In contrast, we describe a repurposed, modular CRISPRi system that attenuates leaky gene expression using a series of single-guide RNAs targeting the PT7/LacO1 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRISPRi to significantly increase the dynamic range of T7 RNA Polymerase (T7RNAP) promoters. In addition, we demonstrate that the CRISPRi system can be applied to enhance growth of bacteria that suffer from leaky expression of a toxic protein. Our work establishes a new application of CRISPRi in genomic engineering to improve the control of recombinant gene expression. The approach is potentially generalizable to other gene expression system by changing the single-guide RNAs.},

  abstract        = {Synthetic biology promises the ability to program cells with new functions. Simple oscillators, switches, logic functions, cell-cell communication and pattern-forming circuits have been created by the connection of a small set of natural transcription factors and their binding sites in different ways to produce different networks of molecular interactions. However, the controlled synthesis of more complex synthetic networks and functions will require an expanded set of functional molecules with known molecular specificities. Here, we tailored the molecular specificity of duplicated Escherichia coli ribosome{\textperiodcentered}mRNA pairs with respect to the wild-type ribosome and mRNAs to produce multiple orthogonal ribosome{\textperiodcentered}orthogonal mRNA pairs that can process information in parallel with, but independent of, their wild-type progenitors. In these pairs, the ribosome exclusively translates the orthogonal mRNA, and the orthogonal mRNA is not a substrate for cellular ribosomes. We predicted and measured the network of interactions between orthogonal ribosomes and orthogonal mRNAs, and showed that they can be used to post-transcriptionally program the cell with Boolean logic. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Orthogonal, parallel and independent, systems are one key foundation for synthetic biology. The synthesis of orthogonal systems that are uncoupled from evolutionary constraints, and selectively abstracted from cellular regulation, is an emerging approach to making biology more amenable to engineering. Here, we combine orthogonal transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and translation by orthogonal ribosomes (O-ribosomes), creating an orthogonal gene expression pathway in Escherichia coli. We design and implement compact, orthogonal gene expression networks. In particular we focus on creating transcription- translation feed-forward loops (FFLs). The transcription-translation FFLs reported cannot be created by using the cells' gene expression machinery and introduce information-processing delays on the order of hours into gene expression. Were factor the rRNA operon, uncoupling the synthesis of the orthogonal 16S rRNA for the O-ribosome from the synthesis and processing of the rest of the rRNA operon, thereby defining a minimal module that can be added to the cell for O-ribosome production. The minimal O-ribosome permits the rational alteration of the delay in an orthogonal gene expression FFL. Overall this work demonstrates that system-level dynamic properties are amenable to rational manipulation and design in orthogonal systems. In the future this system may be further evolved and tuned to provide a spectrum of tailored dynamics in gene expression and investigate the effects of delays in cellular decisionmaking processes.},

abstract = {Cells react to their environment through gene regulatory networks. Network integrity requires minimization of undesired crosstalk between their biomolecules. Similar constraints also limit the use of regulators when building synthetic circuits for engineering applications. Here, we mapped the promoter specificities of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) $\sigma$s as well as the specificity of their interaction with anti‐$\sigma$s. DNA synthesis was used to build 86 ECF $\sigma$s (two from every subgroup), their promoters, and 62 anti‐$\sigma$s identified from the genomes of diverse bacteria. A subset of 20 $\sigma$s and promoters were found to be highly orthogonal to each other. This set can be increased by combining the −35 and −10 binding domains from different subgroups to build chimeras that target sequences unrepresented in any subgroup. The orthogonal $\sigma$s, anti‐$\sigma$s, and promoters were used to build synthetic genetic switches in Escherichia coli. This represents a genome‐scale resource of the properties of ECF $\sigma$s and a resource for synthetic biology, where this set of well‐characterized regulatory parts will enable the construction of sophisticated gene expression programs. The interaction specificities of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma ($\sigma$) factors with promoters and their negative regulators (anti‐$\sigma$s) were mapped to identify non‐crossreacting parts. These orthogonal sets represent a synthetic biology toolbox of genetic switches.

The N‐ and C‐terminal domains from $\sigma$s from different subgroups can be recombined and recognize the corresponding chimeric promoter. These parts functioned off‐the‐shelf in an E. coli host with minimal re‐engineering and minimally affected host growth and gene expression.},

abstract = {Introduction of synthetic circuits into microbes creates competition between circuit and host genes for shared cellular resources, such as ribosomes. This can lead to the emergence of unwanted coupling between the expression of different circuit genes, complicating the design process and potentially leading to circuit failure. By expressing a synthetic 16S rRNA with altered specificity, we can partition the ribosome pool into host-specific and circuit-specific activities. We show mathematically and experimentally that the effects of resource competition can be alleviated by targeting genes to different ribosomal pools. This division of labour can be used to increase flux through a metabolic pathway. We develop a model of cell physiology which is able to capture these observations and use it to design a dynamic resource allocation controller. When implemented, this controller acts to decouple genes by increasing orthogonal ribosome production as the demand for translational resources by a synthetic circuit increases.},
