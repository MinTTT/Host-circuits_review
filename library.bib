abstract = {Large synthetic genetic circuits require the simultaneous expression of many regulators. Deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) can serve as a repressor by having a small guide RNA (sgRNA) direct it to bind a promoter. The programmability and specificity of RNA:DNA basepairing simplifies the generation of many orthogonal sgRNAs that, in theory, could serve as a large set of regulators in a circuit. However, dCas9 is toxic in many bacteria, thus limiting how high it can be expressed, and low concentrations are quickly sequestered by multiple sgRNAs. Here, we construct a non-toxic version of dCas9 by eliminating PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) binding with a R1335K mutation (dCas9∗) and recovering DNA binding by fusing it to the PhlF repressor (dCas9∗PhlF). Both the 30 bp PhlF operator and 20 bp sgRNA binding site are required to repress a promoter. The larger region required for recognition mitigates toxicity in Escherichia coli, allowing up to 9600 ± 800 molecules of dCas9∗PhlF per cell before growth or morphology are impacted, as compared to 530 ± 40 molecules of dCas9. Further, PhlF multimerization leads to an increase in average cooperativity from n = 0.9 (dCas9) to 1.6 (dCas9∗PhlF). A set of 30 orthogonal sgRNA- promoter pairs are characterized as NOT gates; however, the simultaneous use of multiple sgRNAs leads to a monotonic decline in repression and after 15 are co-expressed the dynamic range is {\textless}10-fold. This work introduces a non-toxic variant of dCas9, critical for its use in applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology, and exposes a limitation in the number of regulators that can be used in one cell when they rely on a shared resource.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer permits rapid dissemination of genetic elements between individuals in bacterial populations. Transmitted DNA sequences may encode favourable traits. However, if the acquired DNA has an atypical base composition, it can reduce host fitness. Consequently, bacteria have evolved strategies to minimize the harmful effects of foreign genes. Most notably, xenogeneic silencing proteins bind incoming DNA that has a higher AT content than the host genome. An enduring question has been why such sequences are deleterious. Here, we showed that the toxicity of AT-rich DNA in Escherichia coli frequently results from constitutive transcription initiation within the coding regions of genes. Left unchecked, this causes titration of RNA polymerase and a global downshift in host gene expression. Accordingly, a mutation in RNA polymerase that diminished the impact of AT-rich DNA on host fitness reduced transcription from constitutive, but not activator-dependent, promoters.},

abstract = {A major goal of the BRAIN Initiative is the development of technologies to monitor neuronal network activity during active information processing. Toward this goal, genetically encoded calcium indicator proteins have become widely used for reporting activity in preparations ranging from invertebrates to awake mammals. However, slow response times, the narrow sensitivity range of Ca(2+) and in some cases, poor signal-to-noise ratio still limit their usefulness. Here, we review recent improvements in the field of neural activity-sensitive probe design with a focus on the GCaMP family of calcium indicator proteins. In this context, we present our newly developed Fast-GCaMPs, which have up to 4-fold accelerated off-responses compared with the next-fastest GCaMP, GCaMP6f. Fast-GCaMPs were designed by destabilizing the association of the hydrophobic pocket of calcium-bound calmodulin with the RS20 binding domain, an intramolecular interaction that protects the green fluorescent protein chromophore. Fast-GCaMP6f-RS06 and Fast-GCaMP6f-RS09 have rapid off-responses in stopped-flow fluorimetry, in neocortical brain slices, and in the intact cerebellum in vivo. Fast-GCaMP6f variants should be useful for tracking action potentials closely spaced in time, and for following neural activity in fast-changing compartments, such as axons and dendrites. Finally, we discuss strategies that may allow tracking of a wider range of neuronal firing rates and improve spike detection.},

Although several types of selfish genetic elements exist in nature, few have been successfully engineered in the laboratory thus far. With the discovery of RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated 9) nucleases, which can be utilized to create, streamline and improve synthetic gene drives, this is rapidly changing.

abstract = {To predict the emergence of antibiotic resistance, quantitative relations must be established between the fitness of drug-resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.},

abstract = {Inspired by the relatively simple morphological blueprint provided by batoid fish such as stingrays and skates, we created a biohybrid system that enables an artificial animal—a tissue-engineered ray—to swim and phototactically follow a light cue. By patterning dissociated rat cardiomyocytes on an elastomeric body enclosing a microfabricated gold skeleton, we replicated fish morphology at 1 10= scale and captured basic fin deflection patterns of batoid fish. Optogenetics allows for phototactic guidance, steering, and turning maneuvers. Optical stimulation induced sequential muscle activation via serpentine- patterned muscle circuits, leading to coordinated undulatory swimming. The speed and direction of the ray was controlled by modulating light frequency and by independently eliciting right and left fins, allowing the biohybrid machine to maneuver through an obstacle course.},

Here, by using inducible genetic circuits and cellular communication circuits to regulate Escherichia coli curli amyloid production, we show that E. coli cells can organize self-assembling amyloid fibrils across multiple length scales, producing amyloid-based materials that are either externally controllable or undergo autonomous patterning. We also interfaced curli fibrils with inorganic materials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs), and used these capabilities to create an environmentally responsive biofilm-based electrical switch, produce gold nanowires and nanorods, co-localize AuNPs with CdTe/CdS QDs to modulate QD fluorescence lifetimes, and nucleate the formation of fluorescent ZnS QDs.

abstract = {This paper presents a protocol using theoretical methods and free software to design and analyze multivolume digital PCR (MV digital PCR) devices; the theory and software are also applicable to design and analysis of dilution series in digital PCR. MV digital PCR minimizes the total number of wells required for "digital" (single molecule) measurements while maintaining high dynamic range and high resolution. In some examples, multivolume designs with fewer than 200 total wells are predicted to provide dynamic range with 5-fold resolution similar to that of single-volume designs requiring 12 000 wells. Mathematical techniques were utilized and expanded to maximize the information obtained from each experiment and to quantify performance of devices and were experimentally validated using the SlipChip platform. MV digital PCR was demonstrated to perform reliably, and results from wells of different volumes agreed with one another. No artifacts due to different surface-to-volume ratios were observed, and single molecule amplification in volumes ranging from 1 to 125 nL was self-consistent. The device presented here was designed to meet the testing requirements for measuring clinically relevant levels of HIV viral load at the point-of-care (in plasma, {\textless}500 molecules/mL to {\textgreater}1 000 000 molecules/mL), and the predicted resolution and dynamic range was experimentally validated using a control sequence of DNA. This approach simplifies digital PCR experiments, saves space, and thus enables multiplexing using separate areas for each sample on one chip, and facilitates the development of new high-performance diagnostic tools for resource-limited applications. The theory and software presented here are general and are applicable to designing and analyzing other digital analytical platforms including digital immunoassays and digital bacterial analysis. It is not limited to SlipChip and could also be useful for the design of systems on platforms including valve-based and droplet-based platforms. In a separate publication by Shen et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, DOI: 10.1021/ja2060116), this approach is used to design and test digital RT-PCR devices for quantifying RNA. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Periodic forcing of nonlinear oscillators leads to a large number of dynamic behaviors. The coupling of the cell cycle to the circadian clock provides a biological realization of such forcing. A previous model of forcing leads to nontrivial relations between correlations along cell lineages. Here, we present a simplified two-dimensional nonlinear map for the periodic forcing of the cell cycle. Using high-throughput single-cell microscopy, we have studied the correlations between cell-cycle duration in discrete lineages of several different organisms, including those with known coupling to a circadian clock and those without known coupling to a circadian clock. The model reproduces the paradoxical correlations and predicts new features that can be compared with the experimental data. By fitting the model to the data, we extract the important parameters that govern the dynamics. Interestingly, the model reproduces bimodal distributions for cell-cycle duration, as well as the gating of cell division by the phase of the clock, without having been explicitly fed into the model. In addition, the model predicts that circadian coupling may increase cell-to-cell variability in a clonal population of cells. In agreement with this prediction, deletion of the circadian clock reduces variability. Our results show that simple correlations can identify systems under periodic forcing and that studies of nonlinear coupling of biological oscillators provide insight into basic cellular processes of growth.},

Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them.

The rate of emission was nearly const. between pH 6.5 and 7.5, decreasing at lower and increasing at higher values. Malonate, EDTA, and a series of aliphatic aldehydes (C3-C7) reversibly inhibited the rate but not the total of light emission. Aromatic aldehydes, inorg. reducing or strong oxidizing agents, p-ClHgC6H4CO2H, HgCl2, N1-methylnicotinamide chloride, hydroquinone, benzoquinone, histidine-HCl, dinitrofluorobenzene-NaHCO3, and NCCH2CO2H reduced the total light without affecting the rate of emission; H2O2 had no effect. Aliphatic alcs. increased light emission; C6H5CH2OH caused a slight decrease. The absorption spectrum of I shows a max. at 280 m$\mu$ with a bulge at 310 m$\mu$. In the luminescent reaction the bulge is replaced by a new max. at 333 m$\mu$. These changes suggest the presence of a reduced pyridinium deriv. combined with the protein. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {High-throughput technologies have led to the generation of complex wiring diagrams as a post-sequencing paradigm for depicting the interactions between vast and diverse cellular species. While these diagrams are useful for analyzing biological systems on a large scale, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the observed network connections is critical for the further development of systems and synthetic biology. Here, we use queueing theory to investigate how 'waiting lines' can lead to correlations between protein 'customers' that are coupled solely through a downstream set of enzymatic 'servers'. Using the E. coli ClpXP degradation machine as a model processing system, we observe significant cross-talk between two networks that are indirectly coupled through a common set of processors. We further illustrate the implications of enzymatic queueing using a synthetic biology application, in which two independent synthetic networks demonstrate synchronized behavior when common ClpXP machinery is overburdened. Our results demonstrate that such post-translational processes can lead to dynamic connections in cellular networks and may provide a mechanistic understanding of existing but currently inexplicable links.},

abstract = {Just like in many engineering systems, impedance-like effects, called retroactivity, arise at the interconnection of biomolecular circuits, leading to unexpected changes in a circuit's behavior. In this paper, we provide a combined experimental and theoretical study to characterize the effects of retroactivity on the temporal dynamics of a gene transcription module in vivo. The response of the module to an inducer was measured both in isolation and when the module was connected to downstream clients. The connected module, when compared to the isolated module, responded selectively to the introduction of the inducer versus its withdrawal. Specifically, a "sign-sensitive delay" appeared, in which the connected module displayed a time delay in the response to induction and anticipation in the response to de-induction. The extent of these effects can be made larger by increasing the amounts of downstream clients and/or their binding affinity to the output protein of the module. Our experimental results and mathematical formulas make it possible to predict the extent of the change in the dynamic behavior of a module after interconnection. They can be employed to both recover the predictive power of a modular approach to understand systems or as an additional design tool to shape the temporal behavior of gene transcription. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Among the various biological devices developed and characterized in synthetic biology, light-sensing biological devices can serve as an input-output system owing to their light modulation property. The well-characterized devices in living systems are useful for modulating cellular sensing and transducing information. In this study, we examined short pulse responsiveness of a light-sensing two-component system (TCS), Cph8-OmpR, which was generated by replacing the sensor domain of the EnvZ-OmpR osmoregulatory system with the light sensor Cph1. We varied the input pulse width of the Cph8-OmpR system and found that an input width of {\textless}1 s was sufficient to alter the accumulation of a reporter gene upregulated by Cph8 phosphorylation of OmpR. Based on this result and the mathematical model showing that the timescale for the upstream Cph8-activity transition was much faster than that of downstream gene expression, we evaluated the merit of a TCS with such an unbalanced cascade. Our mathematical simulation of a cascade TCS suggests that high-frequency noise arising from fast transitions in kinase activity was attenuated throughout the cascade reaction. In terms of noise attenuation, these results can contribute to analyze biological cascade systems with the balance of reaction rates in each process. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth.

Hereweinvestigate such an internal conflict within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to control biofilm growth.

abstract = {A grand challenge of systems biology is to predict the kinetic responses of living systems to perturbations starting from the underlying molecular interactions. Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms and they remain a topic of active investigation. Although much is known about the molecular interactions that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied perturbations, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently established coarse-grained proteome allocation models from steady-state growth into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts) without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation, which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are RNA-based regulators of gene expression composed of a ligand-sensing aptamer domain followed by an overlapping expression platform. The regulation occurs at either the level of transcription (by formation of terminator or antiterminator structures) or translation (by presentation or sequestering of the ribosomal binding site). Due to a modular composition, these elements can be manipulated by combining different aptamers and expression platforms and therefore represent useful tools to regulate gene expression in synthetic biology. Using computationally designed theophylline-dependent riboswitches we show that 2 parameters, terminator hairpin stability and folding traps, have a major impact on the functionality of the designed constructs. These have to be considered very carefully during design phase. Furthermore, a combination of several copies of individual riboswitches leads to a much improved activation ratio between induced and uninduced gene activity and to a linear dose-dependent increase in reporter gene expression. Such serial arrangements of synthetic riboswitches closely resemble their natural counterparts and may form the basis for simple quantitative read out systems for the detection of specific target molecules in the cell.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis responses in Escherichia coli are mediated by the phosphorylated response-regulator protein P-CheY. Biochemical and genetic studies have established the mechanisms by which the various components of the chemotaxis system, the membrane receptors and Che proteins function to modulate levels of CheY phosphorylation. Detailed models have been formulated to explain chemotaxis sensing in quantitative terms; however, the models cannot be adequately tested without knowledge of the quantitative relationship between P-CheY and bacterial swimming behavior. A computerized image analysis system was developed to collect extensive statistics on freeswimming and individual tethered cells. P-CheY levels were systematically varied by controlled expression of CheY in an E.coli strain lacking the CheY phosphatase, CheZ, and the receptor demethylating enzyme CheB. Tumbling frequency was found to vary with P-CheY concentration in a weakly sigmoidal fashion (apparent Hill coefficient approximately 2.5). This indicates that the high sensitivity of the chemotaxis system is not derived from highly cooperative interactions between P-CheY and the flagellar motor, but rather depends on nonlinear effects within the chemotaxis signal transduction network. The complex relationship between single flagella rotation and free-swimming behavior was examined; our results indicate that there is an additional level of information processing associated with interactions between the individual flagella. An allosteric model of the motor switching process is proposed which gives a good fit to the observed switching induced by P-CheY. Thus the level of intracellular P-CheY can be estimated from behavior determinations: approximately 30{\%} of the intracellular pool of CheY appears to be phosphorylated in fully adapted wild-type cells.},

abstract = {According to the current view, each microRNA regulates hundreds of genes. Computational tools aim at identifying microRNA targets, usually selecting evolutionarily conserved microRNA binding sites. While the false positive rates have been evaluated for some prediction programs, that information is rarely put forward in studies making use of their predictions. Here, we provide evidence that such predictions are often biologically irrelevant. Focusing on miR-223-guided repression, we observed that it is often smaller than inter-individual variability in gene expression among wild-type mice, suggesting that most predicted targets are functionally insensitive to that microRNA. Furthermore, we found that human haplo-insufficient genes tend to bear the most highly conserved microRNA binding sites. It thus appears that biological functionality of microRNA binding sites depends on the dose-sensitivity of their host gene and that, conversely, it is unlikely that every predicted microRNA target is dose-sensitive enough to be functionally regulated by microRNAs. We also observed that some mRNAs can efficiently titrate microRNAs, providing a reason for microRNA binding site conservation for inefficiently repressed targets. Finally, many conserved microRNA binding sites are conserved in a microRNA-independent fashion: Sequence elements may be conserved for other reasons, while being fortuitously complementary to microRNAs. Collectively, our data suggest that the role of microRNAs in normal and pathological conditions has been overestimated due to the frequent overlooking of false positive rates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social interactions have been increasingly recognized as one of the major factors that contribute to the dynamics and function of bacterial communities. To understand their functional roles and enable the design of robust synthetic consortia, one fundamental step is to determine the relationship between the social interactions of individuals and the spatiotemporal structures of communities. RESULTS: We present a systematic computational survey on this relationship for two-species communities by developing and utilizing a hybrid computational framework that combines discrete element techniques with reaction-diffusion equations. We found that deleterious interactions cause an increased variance in relative abundance, a drastic decrease in surviving lineages, and a rough expanding front. In contrast, beneficial interactions contribute to a reduced variance in relative abundance, an enhancement in lineage number, and a smooth expanding front. We also found that mutualism promotes spatial homogeneity and population robustness while competition increases spatial segregation and population fluctuations. To examine the generality of these findings, a large set of initial conditions with varying density and species abundance was tested and analyzed. In addition, a simplified mathematical model was developed to provide an analytical interpretation of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: This work advances our fundamental understanding of bacterial social interactions and population structures and, simultaneously, benefits synthetic biology for facilitated engineering of artificial microbial consortia.},

abstract = {With the escalation of drug discovery programmes, it has become essential to visualize and monitor biological activities in healthy and pathological cells, with high spatial and temporal resolution. To this aim, the development of probes and sensors, which can report on the levels and activities of specific intracellular targets, has become essential. Together with the discovery of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and the development of GFP-based reporters, recent advances in the synthesis of small molecule fluorescent probes, and the explosion of fluorescence-based imaging technologies, the biosensor field has witnessed a dramatic expansion of fluorescence-based reporters which can be applied to complex biological samples, living cells and tissues to probe protein/protein interactions, conformational changes and posttranslational modifications. Here, we review recent developments in the field of fluorescent biosensor technology. We describe different varieties and categories of fluorescent biosensors together with an overview of the technologies commonly employed to image biosensors in cellulo and in vivo. We discuss issues and strategies related to the choice of synthetic fluorescent probes, labelling, quenching, caging and intracellular delivery of biosensors. Finally, we provide examples of some well-characterized genetically encoded FRET reporter systems, peptide and protein biosensors and describe biosensor applications in a wide variety of fields.},

Simple oscillators, switches, logic functions, cell-cell communication and pattern-forming circuits have been created by the connection of a small set of natural transcription factors and their binding sites in different ways to produce different networks of molecular interactions. However, the controlled synthesis of more complex synthetic networks and functions will require an expanded set of functional molecules with known molecular specificities. Here, we tailored the molecular specificity of duplicated Escherichia coli ribosome{\textperiodcentered}mRNA pairs with respect to the wild-type ribosome and mRNAs to produce multiple orthogonal ribosome{\textperiodcentered}orthogonal mRNA pairs that can process information in parallel with, but independent of, their wild-type progenitors. In these pairs, the ribosome exclusively translates the orthogonal mRNA, and the orthogonal mRNA is not a substrate for cellular ribosomes. We predicted and measured the network of interactions between orthogonal ribosomes and orthogonal mRNAs, and showed that they can be used to post-transcriptionally program the cell with Boolean logic. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

With advances in sequencing and recombinant DNA technology, many of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for the production of these chemically complex and pharmaceutically valuable compounds have been elucidated. With an ever expanding toolkit of biosynthetic components, metabolic engineering is an increasingly powerful method to improve natural product titers and generate novel compounds. Heterologous production platforms have enabled access to pathways from difficult to culture strains; systems biology and metabolic modeling tools have resulted in increasing predictive and analytic capabilities; advances in expression systems and regulation have enabled the fine-tuning of pathways for increased efficiency, and characterization of individual pathway components has facilitated the construction of hybrid pathways for the production of new compounds. These advances in the many aspects of metabolic engineering have not only yielded fascinating scientific discoveries but also make it an increasingly viable approach for the optimization of natural product biosynthesis.},

abstract = {In the process of clone-based genome sequencing, initial assemblies frequently contain cloning gaps that can be resolved using cloning-independent methods, but the reason for their occurrence is largely unknown. By analyzing 9,328,693 sequencing clones from 393 microbial genomes, we systematically mapped more than 15,000 genes residing in cloning gaps and experimentally showed that their expression products are toxic to the Escherichia coli host. A subset of these toxic sequences was further evaluated through a series of functional assays exploring the mechanisms of their toxicity. Among these genes, our assays revealed novel toxins and restriction enzymes, and new classes of small, non-coding toxic RNAs that reproducibly inhibit E. coli growth. Further analyses also revealed abundant, short, toxic DNA fragments that were predicted to suppress E. coli growth by interacting with the replication initiator DnaA. Our results show that cloning gaps, once considered the result of technical problems, actually serve as a rich source for the discovery of biotechnologically valuable functions, and suggest new modes of antimicrobial interventions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

What is needed for co-cultures to fulfil their potential? Cell-cell interactions in co-cultures are strongly influenced by the extracellular environment, which is determined by the experimental set-up, which therefore needs to be given careful consideration. An overview of existing experimental and theoretical co-culture set-ups in synthetic biology and adjacent fields is given here, and challenges and opportunities involved in such experiments are discussed. Greater focus on foundational technology developments for co-cultures is needed for many synthetic biology systems to realize their potential in both applications and answering biological questions.},

This is a sensitive, non-invasive, non-ionizing (clinically safe) and relatively inexpensive technique. Cancer imaging with optical technique however greatly relies upon the use of sensitive and stable optical probes. Unlike the traditional organic fluorescent probes, fluorescent nanoparticle probes such as dye-doped nanoparticles and quantum dots (Qdots) are bright and photostable. Fluorescent nanoparticle probes are shown to be very effective for sensitive cancer imaging with greater success in the cellular level. However, cancer imaging in an in vivo setup has been recently realized. There are several challenges in developing fluorescent nanoparticle probes for in vivo cancer imaging applications. In this review, we will discuss various aspects of nanoparticle design, synthesis, surface functionalization for bioconjugation and cancer cell targeting. A brief overview of in vivo cancer imaging with Qdots will also be presented.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology aspires to develop frameworks that enable the construction of complex and reliable gene networks with predictable functionalities. A key limitation is that increasing network complexity increases the demand for cellular resources, potentially causing resource-associated interference among noninteracting circuits. Although recent studies have shown the effects of resource competition on circuit behaviors, mechanisms that decouple such interference remain unclear. Here, we constructed three systems in Escherichia coli, each consisting of two independent circuit modules where the complexity of one module (Circuit 2) was systematically increased while the other (Circuit 1) remained identical. By varying the expression level of Circuit 1 and measuring its effect on the expression level of Circuit 2, we demonstrated computationally and experimentally that indirect coupling between these seemingly unconnected genetic circuits can occur in three different regulatory topologies. More importantly, we experimentally verified the computational prediction that negative feedback can significantly reduce resource-coupled interference in regulatory circuits. Our results reveal a design principle that enables cells to reliably multitask while tightly controlling cellular resources.},

To understand proteolytic crosstalk beyond the single protease regime, we investigated in E. coli a set of synthetic circuits designed to probe the dynamics of existing and novel degradation tags fused to fluorescent proteins. These circuits were tested using both microplate reader and single-cell assays. We first quantified the degradation rates of each tag in isolation. We then tested if there was crosstalk between two distinguishable fluorescent proteins engineered with identical or different degradation tags. We demonstrated that proteolytic crosstalk was indeed not limited to the LAA degradation tag, but was also apparent between other diverse tags, supporting the complexity of the E. coli protein degradation system.},

We reprogram dual-RNA:Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single- and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. Simultaneous use of two crRNAs enables multiplex mutagenesis. In S. pneumoniae, nearly 100{\%} of cells that were recovered using our approach contained the desired mutation, and in E. coli, 65{\%} that were recovered contained the mutation, when the approach was used in combination with recombineering. We exhaustively analyze dual-RNA:Cas9 target requirements to define the range of targetable sequences and show strategies for editing sites that do not meet these requirements, suggesting the versatility of this technique for bacterial genome engineering.},

Initial circuit designs must rely on often-incomplete models of regulation established by fields of reductive inquiry—biochemistry and molecular and systems biology. As differences in designed and experimentally observed circuit behavior are inevitably encountered, investigated, and resolved, each turn of the engineering cycle can force a resynthesis in understanding of natural network function. Here, we outline research that uses the process of gene circuit engineering to advance biological discovery. Synthetic gene circuit engineering research has not only refined our understanding of cellular regulation but furnished biologists with a toolkit that can be directed at natural systems to exact precision manipulation of network structure. As we discuss, using circuit engineering to predictively reorganize, rewire, and reconstruct cellular regulation serves as the ultimate means of testing and understanding how cellular phenotype emerges from systems-level network function.},

abstract = {In vitro, some RNAs can form stable four-stranded structures known as G-quadruplexes. Although RNA G-quadruplexes have been implicated in posttranscriptional gene regulation and diseases, direct evidence for their formation in cells has been lacking. Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA regions that can fold into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these regions were overwhelmingly unfolded in cells. Model RNA G-quadruplexes that were unfolded in eukaryotic cells were folded when ectopically expressed in Escherichia coli; however, they impaired translation and growth, which helps explain why we detected few G-quadruplex-forming regions in bacterial transcriptomes. Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally unfolds RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex-forming sequences.},

abstract = {NADH and its oxidized form NAD(+) have a central role in energy metabolism, and their concentrations are often considered to be among the most important readouts of metabolic state. Here, we present a detailed protocol to image and monitor NAD(+)/NADH redox state in living cells and in vivo using a highly responsive, genetically encoded fluorescent sensor known as SoNar (sensor of NAD(H) redox). The chimeric SoNar protein was initially developed by inserting circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein (cpYFP) into the NADH-binding domain of Rex protein from Thermus aquaticus (T-Rex). It functions by binding to either NAD(+) or NADH, thus inducing protein conformational changes that affect its fluorescent properties. We first describe steps for how to establish SoNar-expressing cells, and then discuss how to use the system to quantify the intracellular redox state. This approach is sensitive, accurate, simple and able to report subtle perturbations of various pathways of energy metabolism in real time. We also detail the application of SoNar to high-throughput chemical screening of candidate compounds targeting cell metabolism in a microplate-reader-based assay, along with in vivo fluorescence imaging of tumor xenografts expressing SoNar in mice. Typically, the approximate time frame for fluorescence imaging of SoNar is 30 min for living cells and 60 min for living mice. For high-throughput chemical screening in a 384-well-plate assay, the whole procedure generally takes no longer than 60 min to assess the effects of 380 compounds on cell metabolism.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) from the GFP family have become indispensable as marker tools for imaging live cells, tissues and entire organisms. A wide variety of these proteins have been isolated from natural sources and engineered to optimize their properties as genetically encoded markers. Here we review recent developments in this field. A special focus is placed on photoactivatable FPs, for which the fluorescence emission can be controlled by light irradiation at specific wavelengths. They enable regional optical marking in pulse-chase experiments on live cells and tissues, and they are essential marker tools for live-cell optical imaging with super-resolution. Photoconvertible FPs, which can be activated irreversibly via a photo-induced chemical reaction that either turns on their emission or changes their emission wavelength, are excellent markers for localization-based super-resolution microscopy (e.g., PALM). Patterned illumination microscopy (e.g., RESOLFT), however, requires markers that can be reversibly photoactivated many times. Photoswitchable FPs can be toggled repeatedly between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent state by means of a light-induced chromophore isomerization coupled to a protonation reaction. We discuss the mechanistic origins of the effect and illustrate how photoswitchable FPs are employed in RESOLFT imaging. For this purpose, special FP variants with low switching fatigue have been introduced in recent years. Despite nearly two decades of FP engineering by many laboratories, there is still room for further improvement of these important markers for live cell imaging.},

abstract = {Light has emerged as a control input for biological systems due to its precise spatiotemporal resolution. The limited toolset for light control in bacteria motivated us to develop a light-inducible transcription system that is independent from cellular regulation through the use of an orthogonal RNA polymerase. Here, we present our engineered blue light-responsive T7 RNA polymerases (Opto-T7RNAPs) that show properties such as low leakiness of gene expression in the dark state, high expression strength when induced with blue light, and an inducible range of more than 300-fold. Following optimization of the system to reduce expression variability, we created a variant that returns to the inactive dark state within minutes once the blue light is turned off. This allows for precise dynamic control of gene expression, which is a key aspect for most applications using optogenetic regulation. The regulators, which only require blue light from ordinary light-emitting diodes for induction, were developed and tested in the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a crucial cell factory for biotechnology due to its fast and inexpensive cultivation and well understood physiology and genetics. Opto-T7RNAP, with minor alterations, should be extendable to other bacterial species as well as eukaryotes such as mammalian cells and yeast in which the T7 RNA polymerase and the light-inducible Vivid regulator have been shown to be functional. We anticipate that our approach will expand the applicability of using light as an inducer for gene expression independent from cellular regulation and allow for a more reliable dynamic control of synthetic and natural gene networks.},

Experimental validation of {\textgreater}100 predictions in Escherichia coli showed that the method is accurate to within a factor of 2.3 over a range of 100,000-fold. The design method also correctly predicted that reusing identical ribosome binding site sequences in different genetic contexts can result in different protein expression levels. We demonstrate the method's utility by rationally optimizing protein expression to connect a genetic sensor to a synthetic circuit.

abstract = {An improved method for gene replacement in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was developed. The method employs several new gene replacement vectors that incorporate (1) the counterselectable sacB marker, (2) a lacZ$\alpha$-allele for blue-white screening, (3) the pUC18/19 vectors multiple cloning site with 10 unique restriction sites, (4) an oriT for conjugation-mediated plasmid transfer and (5) carbenicillin, gentamicin (Gm) and tetracycline selectable markers. A cassette was constructed that contains a Gm(R) selectable marker next to the green fluorescent protein structural gene, with both markers being flanked by F1p recombinase target (FRT) sites. The FRT cassette was used to insertionally inactivate the cloned P. aeruginosa pabC gene encoding aminodeoxychorismate lyase. After conjugal transfer into P. aeruginosa, plasmid integrants were selected, and deletion of unwanted DNA sequences was promoted by sucrose counterselection. The FRT cassette was excised with high frequencies (close to 100{\%}) from the chromosome after conjugal transfer of a F1p recombinase-expressing plasmid; this sacB-containing plasmid was subsequently cured by sucrose counterselection, resulting in an unmarked P. aeruginosa $\Delta$pabC strain.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the important enzymatic, structural and regulatory roles of RNA in the cell. Here we present a post-transcriptional regulation system in Escherichia coli that uses RNA to both silence and activate gene expression. We inserted a complementary cis sequence directly upstream of the ribosome binding site in a target gene. Upon transcription, this cis-repressive sequence causes a stem-loop structure to form at the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA. The stem-loop structure interferes with ribosome binding, silencing gene expression. A small noncoding RNA that is expressed in trans targets the cis-repressed RNA with high specificity, causing an alteration in the stem-loop structure that activates expression. Such engineered riboregulators may lend insight into mechanistic actions of endogenous RNA-based processes and could serve as scalable components of biological networks, able to function with any promoter or gene to directly control gene expression.},

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Microfluidic lab-on-chip technology combined with live-cell imaging has enabled the observation of single cells in their spatio-temporal context. The mother machine (MM) cultivation system is particularly attractive for the long-term investigation of rod-shaped bacteria since it facilitates continuous cultivation and observation of individual cells over many generations in a highly parallelized manner. To date, the lack of fully automated image analysis software limits the practical applicability of the MM as a phenotypic screening tool. RESULTS We present an image analysis pipeline for the automated processing of MM time lapse image stacks. The pipeline supports all analysis steps, i.e., image registration, orientation correction, channel/cell detection, cell tracking, and result visualization. Tailored algorithms account for the specialized MM layout to enable a robust automated analysis. Image data generated in a two-day growth study (≈ 90 GB) is analyzed in ≈ 30 min with negligible differences in growth rate between automated and manual evaluation quality. The proposed methods are implemented in the software molyso (MOther machine AnaLYsis SOftware) that provides a new profiling tool to analyze unbiasedly hitherto inaccessible large-scale MM image stacks. CONCLUSION Presented is the software molyso, a ready-to-use open source software (BSD-licensed) for the unsupervised analysis of MM time-lapse image stacks. molyso source code and user manual are available at https://github.com/modsim/molyso.},

@article{Martinez-Hackert1997,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The differential expression of the ompF and ompC genes is regulated by two proteins that belong to the two component family of signal transduction proteins: the histidine kinase, EnvZ, and the response regulator, OmpR. OmpR belongs to a subfamily of at least 50 response regulators with homologous C-terminal DNA-binding domains of approximately 98 amino acids. Sequence homology with DNA-binding proteins of known structure cannot be detected, and the lack of structural information has prevented understanding of many of this familys functional properties. RESULTS: We have determined the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli OmpR C-terminal domain at 1.95 A resolution. The structure consists of three alpha helices packed against two antiparallel beta sheets. Two helices, alpha2 and alpha3, and the ten residue loop connecting them constitute a variation of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. Helix alpha3 and the loop connecting the two C-terminal beta strands, beta6 and beta7, are probable DNA-recognition sites. Previous mutagenesis studies indicate that the large loop connecting helices alpha2 and alpha3 is the site of interaction with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. CONCLUSIONS: OmpRc belongs to the family of 'winged helix-turn-helix' DNA-binding proteins. This relationship, and the results from numerous published mutagenesis studies, have helped us to interpret the functions of most of the structural elements present in this protein domain. The structure of OmpRc could be useful in helping to define the positioning of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase in relation to transcriptional activators that are bound to DNA.},

This integrated platform broadly enables experiments that bridge individual and population behaviors. We demonstrate: (i) population structuring by independent closed-loop control of gene expression in many individual cells, (ii) cell-cell variation control during antibiotic perturbation, (iii) hybrid bio-digital circuits in single cells, and freely specifiable digital communication between individual bacteria. These examples showcase the potential for real-time integration of theoretical models with measurement and control of many individual cells to investigate and engineer microbial population behavior.},

Recent attempts to produce novel proteins have focused largely on rational design involving significant computational efforts. In contrast, nature does not design sequences a priori. Instead, nature relies on Darwinian evolution to select biologically functional sequences from nondesigned sequence space. To mimic natural selection in the laboratory, we combed through libraries of novel sequences and selected proteins that rescue E. coli cells deleted for conditionally essential genes. One such gene, gltA, encodes citrate synthase, the enzyme responsible for metabolic entry into the citric acid cycle. The de novo protein SynGltA was isolated as a rescuer of $\Delta$gltA. However, SynGltA is not an enzyme. Instead, SynGltA allows cells to recover from a defect in central carbon and energy metabolism by altering the regulation of an alternative metabolic pathway.

abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are brightly luminescent nanoparticles that have found numerous applications in bioanalysis and bioimaging. In this review, we highlight recent developments in these areas in the context of specific methods for fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging. Following a primer on the structure, properties, and biofunctionalization of QDs, we describe select examples of how QDs have been used in combination with steady-state or time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to develop a variety of assays, bioprobes, and biosensors that function via changes in QD photoluminescence intensity, polarization, or lifetime. Some special attention is paid to the use of F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer-type methods in bioanalysis, including those based on bioluminescence and chemiluminescence. Direct chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, and charge transfer quenching are similarly discussed. We further describe the combination of QDs and flow cytometry, including traditional cellular analyses and spectrally encoded barcode-based assay technologies, before turning our attention to enhanced fluorescence techniques based on photonic crystals or plasmon coupling. Finally, we survey the use of QDs across different platforms for biological fluorescence imaging, including epifluorescence, confocal, and two-photon excitation microscopy; single particle tracking and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; super-resolution imaging; near-field scanning optical microscopy; and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. In each of the above-mentioned platforms, QDs provide the brightness needed for highly sensitive detection, the photostability needed for tracking dynamic processes, or the multiplexing capacity needed to elucidate complex systems. There is a clear synergy between advances in QD materials and spectroscopy and imaging techniques, as both must be applied in concert to achieve their full potential.},

Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we analyzed sigma factor activity dynamics, and their competition for RNA polymerase, in individual Bacillus subtilis cells under energy stress. Multiple alternative sigma factors were activated in ∼1-hr pulses in stochastic and repetitive fashion. Pairwise analysis revealed that two sigma factors rarely pulse simultaneously and that some pairs are anti-correlated, indicating that RNAP utilization alternates among different sigma factors. Mathematical modeling revealed how stochastic time-sharing dynamics can emerge from pulse-generating sigma factor regulatory circuits actively competing for RNAP. Time sharing provides a mechanism for cells to dynamically control the distribution of cell states within a population. Since core molecular components are limiting in many other systems, time sharing may represent a general mode of regulation. Cellular regulatory factors often compete for limited amounts of core enzymes. Sharing is typically assumed to involve statically partitioning core enzyme molecules. In contrast, using time-lapse movies, we find that Bacillus subtilis alternative sigma factors, which compete for core RNA polymerase, activate dynamically in stochastic, repetitive, hour-long pulses. Using mathematical modeling, we show how such pulsatile competitive circuits can effectively time share, or take turns using, core polymerase under similar conditions. Time-sharing represents an alternative mode of resource sharing in cells.},

abstract = {Tight control and multifactorial regulation of gene expression are important challenges in genetic engineering and are critical for the development of regulatory circuits. Meeting these challenges will facilitate transgene expression regulation and support the fine-tuning of metabolic pathways to avoid the accumulation of undesired intermediates. By employing the endoribonuclease Csy4 and its recognition sequence from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and manipulating 5'UTR of mRNA, we developed a two-component expression-repression system to tightly control synthesis of transgene products. We demonstrated that this regulatory device was functional in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, and showed that it can be used to repress transgene expression by {\textgreater}400-fold and to synchronize transgene repression. In addition to tissue-specific transgene repression, this system offers stimuli-dependent expression control. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified 54 orthologous systems from various bacteria, and then validated in planta the activity for a few of those systems, demonstrating the potential diversity of such a two-component repressor system.},

abstract = {Population diversification strategies are ubiquitous among microbes, encompassing random phase-variation (RPV) of pathogenic bacteria, viral latency as observed in some bacteriophage and HIV, and the non-genetic diversity of bacterial stress responses. Precise conditions under which these diversification strategies confer an advantage have not been well defined. We develop a model of population growth conditioned on dynamical environmental and cellular states. Transitions among cellular states, in turn, may be biased by possibly noisy readings of the environment from cellular sensors. For various types of environmental dynamics and cellular sensor capability, we apply game-theoretic analysis to derive the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for an organism and determine when that strategy is diversification. We find that: (1) RPV, effecting a sort of Parrondo paradox wherein random alternations between losing strategies produce a winning strategy, is selected when transitions between different selective environments cannot be sensed, (2) optimal RPV cell switching rates are a function of environmental lifecycle asymmetries and environmental autocorrelation, (3) probabilistic diversification upon entering a new environment is selected when sensors can detect environmental transitions but have poor precision in identifying new environments, and (4) in the presence of excess additive noise, low-pass filtering is required for evolutionary stability. We show that even when RPV is not the ESS, it may minimize growth rate variance and the risk of extinction due to 'unlucky' environmental dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The PAS protocol involves the following five steps: (i) design of the DNA sequence to be synthesized and of 60-bp overlapping oligonucleotides to cover the entire DNA sequence; (ii) purification of the oligonucleotides by PAGE; (iii) first PCR, to synthesize DNA fragments of 400-500 bp in length using 10 inner (template) and two outer (primer) oligonucleotides; (iv) second PCR, to assemble the products of the first PCR into the full-length DNA sequence; and (v) cloning and verification of the synthetic DNA by sequencing and, if needed, error correction using an overlap-extension PCR technique. This method, which takes approximately 1 wk, is suitable for synthesizing diverse types of long DNA molecule. We have successfully synthesized DNA fragments from 0.5 to 12.0 kb, with high G+C content, repetitive sequences or complex secondary structures. The PAS protocol therefore provides a simple, rapid, reliable and relatively inexpensive method for synthesizing long, accurate DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate is a bacterial second messenger that has been implicated in biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and persistence of pathogenic bacteria in their animal host. Although the enzymes responsible for the regulation of cellular levels of c-di-GMP, diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and phosphodiesterases, have been identified recently, little information is available on the molecular mechanisms involved in controlling the activity of these key enzymes or on the specific interactions of c-di-GMP with effector proteins. By using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and modeling techniques we demonstrate that an allosteric binding site for c-di-GMP (I-site) is responsible for non-competitive product inhibition of DGCs. The I-site was mapped in both multi- and single domain DGC proteins and is fully contained within the GGDEF domain itself. In vivo selection experiments and kinetic analysis of the evolved I-site mutants led to the definition of an RXXD motif as the core c-di-GMP binding site. Based on these results and based on the observation that the I-site is conserved in a majority of known and potential DGC proteins, we propose that product inhibition of DGCs is of fundamental importance for c-di-GMP signaling and cellular homeostasis. The definition of the I-site binding pocket provides an entry point into unraveling the molecular mechanisms of ligand-protein interactions involved in c-di-GMP signaling and makes DGCs a valuable target for drug design to develop new strategies against biofilm-related diseases.},

Our technique also allows for automated microscopy at high throughput with minimal perturbation to native physiology, as well as viable enrichment/retrieval. We illustrate the method by analysing the control of the master regulator of the E. coli stress response, RpoS, by its adapter protein, SprE (RssB). Quantification of SprE numbers shows that though SprE is necessary for RpoS degradation, it is expressed at levels as low as 3-4 molecules per average cell cycle, and fluctuations in SprE are approximately Poisson distributed during exponential phase with no sign of bursting.},

It is shown that this system can lead to instabilities beyond which a new state organized in time or in space (dissipative structure) can be reached. The conditions for both types of instabilities are presented and the occurrence of a temporal structure, consisting of a limit cycle behavior, is determined numerically as a function of the important parameters involved in the system. Sustained oscillations in the product and substrate concentrations are shown to occur for acceptable values of the allosteric and kinetic constants; moreover, they seem to be favored by substrate activation. The model is applied to phosphofructokinase, which is the enzyme chiefly responsible for glycolytic oscillations and which presents the same pattern of regulation as the allosteric enzyme appearing in the model.

abstract = {Microfluidics is revolutionizing the way we study the motile behavior of cells, by enabling observations at high spatial and temporal resolution in carefully controlled microenvironments. An important class of such behavior is bacterial chemotaxis, which plays a fundamental role in a broad range of processes, including disease pathogenesis, biofilm formation, bioremediation, and even carbon cycling in the ocean. In biophysical research, bacterial chemotaxis represents a powerful model system to understand how cells and organisms sense and respond to gradients. Using microfluidics to study chemotaxis of free-swimming bacteria presents experimental challenges that are distinct from those arising in chemotaxis studies of surface-adherent cells. Recently, these challenges have been met by the development of advanced microdevices, able to generate flow-free, steady gradients of arbitrary shape. Much attention to date has been focused on tool development. Yet, we are now at an exciting turning point where science begins to balance technology. Indeed, recent microfluidic studies provided new insights on both the mechanisms governing bacterial gradient sensing (e.g. tuning of response sensitivity, discrimination between conflicting gradients) and the large-scale consequences of chemotaxis (e.g. in the oceans). Here we outline the principles underlying recently proposed gradient generators for bacterial chemotaxis, illustrate the advantage of the microfluidic approach through selected examples, and identify a broader set of scientific questions that may now be addressed with this rapidly developing technology. The latest generation of microfluidic gradient generators, in particular, holds appeal for both biophysicists seeking to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, and ecologists wishing to model chemotaxis in realistic environments. Time is ripe for a deeper integration between technology and biology in fully bringing to bear microfluidics on studies of this fascinating microbial behavior.},

This knowledge also drives modern biotechnologies, such as molecular engineering and synthetic biology, which have enormous potential to address urgent problems, including developing potent new drugs and providing environmentally friendly energy. Many of these studies, however, are ultimately limited by their need for even-higher-throughput measurements of biochemical reactions. We present a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using drop-based microfluidics that overcomes these limitations and revolutionizes both the scale and speed of screening. We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To demonstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifying new mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase exhibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inactive mutants; we identify approximately 100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of approximately 10(7). After a second generation of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffusion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen approximately 10(8) individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using {\textless} 150 microL of total reagent volume; compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we perform the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost.},

@article{marr1991growth,
abstract = {It should be possible to predict the rate of growth of Escherichia coli of a given genotype in a specified environment. The idea that the rate of synthesis of ATP determines the rate of growth and that the yield of ATP determines the yield of growth is entrenched in bacterial physiology, yet this idea is inconsistent with experimental results. In minimal media the growth rate and yield vary with the carbon source in a manner independent of the rate of formation and yield of ATP. With acetate as the carbon source, anapleurotic reactions, not ATP synthesis, limit the growth rate. For acetate and other gluconeogenic substrates the limiting step appears to be the formation of triose phosphate. I conclude that the rate of growth is controlled by the rate of formation of a precursor metabolite and, thus, of monomers such as amino acids derived from it. The protein-synthesizing system is regulated according to demand for protein synthesis. I examine the conjecture that the signal for this regulation is the ratio of uncharged tRNA to aminoacyl-tRNA, that this signal controls the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate, and that the concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate controls transcription of rrn genes. Differential equations describing this system were solved numerically for steady states of growth; the computed values of ribosomes and guanosine tetraphosphate and the maximal growth rate agree with experimental values obtained from the literature of the past 35 years. These equations were also solved for dynamical states corresponding to nutritional shifts up and down.},

The simplest examples of the eukaryotic cell cycle operate like autonomous oscillators. Here, we present the basic theory of oscillatory biochemical circuits in the context of the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle. We examine Boolean models, delay differential equation models, and especially ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. For ODE models, we explore what it takes to get oscillations out of two simple types of circuits (negative feedback loops and coupled positive and negative feedback loops). Finally, we review the procedures of linear stability analysis, which allow one to determine whether a given ODE model and a particular set of kinetic parameters will produce oscillations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The natural riboswitches have inspired several designs of synthetic analogues capable of gene regulation in response to a small molecule trigger. In this work, we describe our efforts to engineer complex riboswitches capable of sensing and responding to two small molecules according to Boolean logics AND and NAND. Two aptamers that recognize theophylline and thiamine pyrophosphate were embedded in tandem in the 5' UTR of bacterial mRNA, and riboswitches that function as logic gates were isolated by dual genetic selection. The diverse phenotype of the engineered logic gates supports the versatility of RNA-based gene regulation which may have preceded the modern protein-based gene regulators. Additionally, our design strategy advances our ability to harness the versatile capacities of RNA to program complex behavior in bacteria without the use of engineered proteins.},

abstract = {With the expanding interest in cellular responses to dynamic environments, microfluidic devices have become important experimental platforms for biological research. Microfluidic “microchemostat” devices enable precise environmental control while capturing high quality, single-cell gene expression data. For studies of population heterogeneity and gene expression noise, these abilities are crucial. Here, we describe the necessary steps for experimental microfluidics using devices created in our lab as examples. First, we discuss the rational design of microchemostats and the tools available to predict their performance. We carefully analyze the critical parts of an example device, focusing on the most important part of any microchemostat: the cell trap. Next, we present a method for generating on-chip dynamic environments using an integrated fluidic junction coupled to linear actuators. Our system relies on the simple modulation of hydrostatic pressure to alter the mixing ratio between two source reservoirs and we detail the software and hardware behind it. To expand the throughput of microchemostat experiments, we describe how to build larger, parallel versions of simpler devices. To analyze the large amounts of data, we discuss methods for automated cell tracking, focusing on the special problems presented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The manufacturing of microchemostats is described in complete detail: from the photolithographic processing of the wafer to the final bonding of the PDMS chip to glass coverslip. Finally, the procedures for conducting Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae microchemostat experiments are addressed.},

abstract = {Despite rapid advances over the last decade, synthetic biology lacks the predictive tools needed to enable rational design. Unlike established engineering disciplines, the engineering of synthetic gene circuits still relies heavily on experimental trial-and-error, a time-consuming and inefficient process that slows down the biological design cycle. This reliance on experimental tuning is because current modeling approaches are unable to make reliable predictions about the in vivo behavior of synthetic circuits. A major reason for this lack of predictability is that current models view circuits in isolation, ignoring the vast number of complex cellular processes that impinge on the dynamics of the synthetic circuit and vice versa. To address this problem, we present a modeling approach for the design of synthetic circuits in the context of cellular networks. Using the recently published whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium, we examined the effect of adding genes into the host genome. We also investigated how codon usage correlates with gene expression and find agreement with existing experimental results. Finally, we successfully implemented a synthetic Goodwin oscillator in the whole-cell model. We provide an updated software framework for the whole-cell model that lays the foundation for the integration of whole-cell models with synthetic gene circuit models. This software framework is made freely available to the community to enable future extensions. We envision that this approach will be critical to transforming the field of synthetic biology into a rational and predictive engineering discipline. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Much of this work has been accomplished using engineered microorganisms that act as chemical factories. Although the time required to engineer microbial chemical factories has steadily decreased, improvement is still needed. Through the development of synthetic biology tools for key microbial hosts, it should be possible to further decrease the development times and improve the reliability of the resulting microorganism. Together with continuous decreases in price and improvements in DNA synthesis, assembly and sequencing, synthetic biology tools will rationalize time-consuming strain engineering, improve control of metabolic fluxes, and diversify screening assays for cellular metabolism. This review outlines some recently developed synthetic biology tools and their application to improve production of chemicals and fuels in yeast.

abstract = {We formulate the general theory of random walks in continuum, essential for treating a collision rate which depends smoothly upon direction of motion. We also consider a smooth probability distribution of correlations between the directions of motion before and after collisions, as well as orientational Brownian motion between collisions. These features lead to an effective Smoluchowski equation. Such random walks involving an infinite number of distinct directions of motion cannot be treated on a lattice, which permits only a finite number of directions of motion, nor by Langevin methods, which make no reference to individual collisions. The effective Smoluchowski equation enables a description of the biased random walk of the bacterium Escherichia coli during chemotaxis, its search for food. The chemotactic responses of cells which perform temporal comparsions of the concentration of a chemical attractant are predicted to be strongly positive, whereas those of cells which measure averages of the am- bient attractant concentration are predicted to be negative. The former prediction explains the observed behavior of wild-type (naturally occurring) cells; however, the latter behavior has yet to be observed, even in cells defective in adaption.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license Genetic circuits implement computational operations within a cell. Debugging them is difficult because their function is defined by multiple states (e.g., combinations of inputs) that vary in time. Here, we develop RNA-seq methods that enable the simultaneous measurement of: (i) the states of internal gates, (ii) part performance (promoters, insulators, terminators), and (iii) impact on host gene expression. This is applied to a three-input one-output circuit consisting of three sensors, five NOR/NOT gates, and 46 genetic parts. Transcription profiles are obtained for all eight combinations of inputs, from which biophysical models can extract part activities and the response functions of sensors and gates. Various unexpected failure modes are identified, including cryptic antisense promoters, terminator failure, and a sensor malfunction due to media-induced changes in host gene expression. This can guide the selection of new parts to fix these problems, which we demonstrate by using a bidirectional terminator to disrupt observed antisense transcription. This work introduces RNA-seq as a powerful method for circuit characterization and debugging that overcomes the limitations of fluorescent reporters and scales to large systems composed of many parts.},

abstract = {Background—There is little empirical evidence on the effect of childhood malnutrition on children's cognitive achievements in low income countries like Ethiopia. A longitudinal data is thus vital to understand the factors that influence cognitive development of children over time, particularly how early childhood stunting affects cognitive achievement of children up to the age of 8 years. Objective—To examine the effect of early childhood stunting on cognitive achievements of children using longitudinal data that incorporate anthropometric measurements and results of cognitive achievement tests such as Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and Cognitive Development Assessment quantitative tests. Method—Defining stunted children as those having a standardized height for age z-score less than −2; we used a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to examine the effect of early childhood stunting on measures of cognitive performance of children. The balance of the propensity score matching techniques was checked and found to be satisfied (P{\textless}0.01) Results—Early childhood stunting is significantly negatively associated with cognitive performance of children. Controlled for confounding variables such as length of breastfeeding, relative size of the child at birth, health problems of early childhood such as acute respiratory illness and malaria, baseline household wealth, child gender, household size and parental education, estimates from PSM show that stunted children scored 16.1{\%} less in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and 48.8{\%} less in the Quantitative Assessment test at the age of eight, both statistically significant at P{\textless}0.01. Conclusions—It is important to realize the importance of early investment in terms of child health and nutrition until five years for the cognitive performance of children. As household wealth and parental education are particularly found to play an important role in children's nutritional achievements, policy measures that are directed in improving household's livelihood may have a spill-over impact in improving child nutritional status, and consequently cognitive development and schooling.},

abstract = {Predicting the dynamic behavior of a large network from that of the composing modules is a central problem in systems and synthetic biology. Yet, this predictive ability is still largely missing because modules display context-dependent behavior. One cause of context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon similar to loading that influences in non-trivial ways the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. Here, we establish an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. Specifically, a module's key properties are encoded by three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. All of them have a physical interpretation and can be computed from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and promoter concentrations) and from the modules' topology. The internal retroactivity quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics. The scaling and mixing retroactivity establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. Based on these matrices and on the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. We further provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be employed both to evaluate the extent of modularity of natural networks and to establish concrete design guidelines to minimize retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Gyorgy, Del Vecchio.},

abstract = {The small nucleotides pppGpp and ppGpp (or (p)ppGpp) are rapidly synthesized in response to nutritional stress. In Escherichia coli, the enzymes RelA and SpoT are triggered by different starvation signals to produce (p)ppGpp. In many Gram-positive bacteria this is carried out by RelA and two small homologs. (p)ppGpp, along with the transcription factor DksA, has profound effects on transcription initiation in E. coli. (p)ppGpp/DksA exert differential effects on promoters by playing upon their intrinsic kinetic parameters, and by facilitating the utilization of alternative sigma factors. (p)ppGpp also regulates replication and translation. These studies highlight (p)ppGpp as a key factor in bacterial physiology that responds rapidly to diverse stresses, by shutting down growth and priming cellular defensive and adaptive processes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Homeostasis is a recurring theme in biology that ensures that regulated variables robustly—and in some systems, completely—adapt to environmental perturbations. This robust perfect adaptation feature is achieved in natural circuits by using integral control, a negative feedback strategy that performs mathematical integration to achieve structurally robust regulation1,2. Despite its benefits, the synthetic realization of integral feedback in living cells has remained elusive owing to the complexity of the required biological computations. Here we prove mathematically that there is a single fundamental biomolecular controller topology3 that realizes integral feedback and achieves robust perfect adaptation in arbitrary intracellular networks with noisy dynamics. This adaptation property is guaranteed both for the population-average and for the time-average of single cells. On the basis of this concept, we genetically engineer a synthetic integral feedback controller in living cells4 and demonstrate its tunability and adaptation properties. A growth-rate control application in Escherichia coli shows the intrinsic capacity of our integral controller to deliver robustness and highlights its potential use as a versatile controller for regulation of biological variables in uncertain networks. Our results provide conceptual and practical tools in the area of cybergenetics3,5, for engineering synthetic controllers that steer the dynamics of living systems3–9.},

abstract = {How fast can a cell locate a specific chromosomal DNA sequence specified by a single-stranded oligonucleotide? To address this question, we investigate the intracellular search processes of the Cas9 protein, which can be programmed by a guide RNA to bind essentially any DNA sequence. This targeting flexibility requires Cas9 to unwind the DNA double helix to test for correct base pairing to the guide RNA. Here we study the search mechanisms of the catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in living Escherichia coli by combining single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and bulk restriction-protection assays. We find that it takes a single fluorescently labeled dCas9 6 hours to find the correct target sequence, which implies that each potential target is bound for less than 30 milliseconds. Once bound, dCas9 remains associated until replication. To achieve fast targeting, both Cas9 and its guide RNA have to be present at high concentrations.},

abstract = {Rajiform locomotion is a unique swimming style found in the batoid fishes (skates and rays) in which thrust is generated by undulatory waves passing down the enlarged pectoral fins. We examined the kinematic patterns of fin motion and the motor patterns of pectoral fin muscles driving the locomotor system in the blue-spot stingray Taeniura lymma. Our goals in this study were to determine overall patterns of fin motion and motor control during undulatory locomotion, to discover how these patterns change with swimming velocity and to correlate muscle function with kinematics and pectoral morphology. Kinematic data were recorded from five individuals over a range of swimming speeds from 22 to 55 cm s(-)(1) (0.9-3.0 DL s(-)(1), where DL is body disc length). Electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from three individuals over a range of velocities (1.2-3.0 DL s(-)(1)) at seven locations (four dorsal, three ventral) along the pectoral fin. As swimming velocity increases, fin-beat frequency, wavespeed and stride length increase, number of waves and reduced frequency decrease and fin amplitude remains constant. There is variability among individuals in frequency and amplitude at a given speed. An inverse relationship was found in which a high fin-beat frequency is associated with a low fin amplitude and a low fin-beat frequency is associated with a high fin amplitude. The motor pattern of undulatory locomotion is alternate firing activity in the dorsal and ventral muscles as the wave moves along the fin from anterior to posterior. Fin muscles are active along the entire length of the fin except at the lowest speeds. As swimming velocity and fin-beat frequency increase, the time of activation of posterior muscles becomes earlier relative to the onset of activity in the anterior dorsal muscles. The duration of muscle activity is longer in the ventral muscles than in the dorsal muscles, indicating that they play a central role in the power stroke of the fin-beat cycle. The anterior muscles (dorsal and ventral) are active for a relatively longer part of the stride cycle than the posterior muscles. Both the anterior position and the large duty factor of the anterior muscles reflect the role of these muscles in initial wave generation. Synchronous recordings of kinematic data with EMG data reveal that the anterior dorsal and middle ventral muscles do mostly positive work, whereas the dorsal and ventral posterior muscles do negative work at most swimming speeds.},

abstract = {DNA assembly methods are essential tools for biological research and biotechnology. Therefore various methods have been developed to clone DNA fragments of interest. Conventional methods usually require several cloning steps to generate a construct of interest. At each step, a single DNA fragment is transferred from a donor plasmid or PCR product to a recipient vector. In the past few years, a number of methods have been developed to facilitate and speed up this process. One of these methods, Golden Gate cloning, allows assembling up to nine fragments at a time in a recipient plasmid. Cloning is performed by pipetting in a single tube all plasmid donors, the recipient vector, a type IIS restriction enzyme and ligase, and incubating the mix in a thermal cycler. Despite the simplicity of the cloning procedure, the majority of clones obtained after transformation contain the expected construct. Using Golden Gate cloning however requires the use of carefully designed donor and recipient plasmids. We provide here a protocol describing how to design these plasmids and also describe the conditions necessary to perform the assembly reaction.},

This review examines the state-of-the-art, including methods for active encapsulation.There is a recognized and growing need for rapid and efficient cell assays, where the size of microfluidic devices lend themselves to the manipulation of cellular populations down to the single cell level. An exceptional way to analyze cells independently is to encapsulate them within aqueous droplets surrounded by an immiscible fluid, so that reagents and reaction products are contained within a controlled microenvironment. Most cell encapsulation work has focused on the development and use of passive methods, where droplets are produced continuously at high rates by pumping fluids from external pressure-driven reservoirs through defined microfluidic geometries. With limited exceptions, the number of cells encapsulated per droplet in these systems is dictated by Poisson statistics, reducing the proportion of droplets that contain the desired number of cells and thus the effective rate at which single cells can be encapsulated. Nevertheless, a number of recently developed actively-controlled droplet production methods present an alternative route to the production of droplets at similar rates and with the potential to improve the efficiency of single-cell encapsulation. In this critical review, we examine both passive and active methods for droplet production and explore how these can be used to deterministically and non-deterministically encapsulate cells.},

Quantitative analysis of these properties is often difficult in naturally occurring systems but can be greatly facilitated by studying simple synthetic networks. Here, we report the construction of synthetic transcriptional cascades comprising one, two, and three repression stages. These model systems enable us to analyze sensitivity and noise propagation as a function of network complexity. We demonstrate experimentally steady-state switching behavior that becomes sharper with longer cascades. The regulatory mechanisms that confer this ultrasensitive response both attenuate and amplify phenotypical variations depending on the system's input conditions. Although noise attenuation allows the cascade to act as a low-pass filter by rejecting short-lived perturbations in input conditions, noise amplification results in loss of synchrony among a cell population. The experimental results demonstrating the above network properties correlate well with simulations of a simple mathematical model of the system. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Systems biology aims at achieving a system-level understanding of living organisms and applying this knowledge to various fields such as synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and medicine. System-level understanding of living organisms can be derived from insight into: (i) system structure and the mechanism of biological networks such as gene regulation, protein interactions, signaling, and metabolic pathways; (ii) system dynamics of biological networks, which provides an understanding of stability, robustness, and transduction ability through system identification, and through system analysis methods; (iii) system control methods at different levels of biological networks, which provide an understanding of systematic mechanisms to robustly control system states, minimize malfunctions, and provide potential therapeutic targets in disease treatment; (iv) systematic design methods for the modification and construction of biological networks with desired behaviors, which provide system design principles and system simulations for synthetic biology designs and systems metabolic engineering. This review describes current developments in systems biology, systems synthetic biology, and systems metabolic engineering for engineering and biology researchers. We also discuss challenges and future prospects for systems biology and the concept of systems biology as an integrated platform for bioinformatics, systems synthetic biology, and systems metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {We present a joint experimental/theoretical investigation into the roles of spatial structure and time in the competition between two pathogens for a single host. We suggest a natural mechanism by which competing pathogens can coexist when host evolution and competitive dynamics occur on similar timescales. Our experimental system consisted of a single bacterial host species and two competing bacteriophage strains grown on agar plates, with a serial transfer of samples of the bacteriophage population to fresh host populations after each incubation cycle. The experiments included two incubation times and two transfer protocols that either maintained or disrupted the spatial structure of the viruses at each transfer. The same bacteriophage acted as the dominant competitor under both transfer protocols. A striking difference between the treatments is that the weak competitor was able to persist in the long-incubation experiments but not in the short-incubation experiments. Mathematical and experimental evidence suggest that coexistence is due to the appearance of resistant mutant host cells that provide a transient "spatiotemporal refuge" for the weaker competitor. Our mathematical model is individual based, captures the stochastic spatial dynamics down to the level of individual cells, and helps to explain the differences in behavior under the various experimental conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Abstract When bacteria are cultured in medium with multiple carbon substrates, they frequently consume these substrates simultaneously. Building on recent advances in the understanding of metabolic coordination exhibited by Escherichia coli cells through cAMP-Crp signaling, we show that this signaling system responds to the total carbon-uptake flux when substrates are co-utilized and derive a mathematical formula that accurately predicts the resulting growth rate, based only on the growth rates on individual substrates. Synopsis When cultured in medium containing two carbon substrates, E. coli frequently consumes both simultaneously. A mathematical formula based on simple assumptions accurately predicts the resulting growth rate from the growth rate on each substrate alone. Catabolite repression by cAMP-Crp regulates the total carbon uptake flux through a negative feedback loop. The uptake of one substrate non-specifically reduces the uptake of a second, co-utilizable substrate. A growth-rate composition formula is derived that accurately predicts the growth rate on two co-utilized substrates based on the growth rate on either substrate alone. When cultured in medium containing two carbon substrates, E. coli frequently consumes both simultaneously. A mathematical formula based on simple assumptions accurately predicts the resulting growth rate from the growth rate on each substrate alone.},

abstract = {The rational design of synthetic regulatory circuits critically hinges on the availability of orthogonal and well-characterized building blocks. Here, we focus on extracytoplasmic function (ECF) factors, which are the largest group of alternative factors and hold extensive potential as synthetic orthogonal regulators. By assembling multiple ECF factors into regulatory cascades of varying length, we benchmark the scalability of the approach, showing that these 'autonomous timer circuits' feature a tuneable time delay between inducer addition and target gene activation. The implementation of similar timers in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis shows strikingly convergent circuit behavior, which can be rationalized by a computational model. These findings not only reveal ECF factors as powerful building blocks for a rational, multi-layered circuit design, but also suggest that ECF factors are universally applicable as orthogonal regulators in a variety of bacterial species.},

At growth rates between 0.6 and 2.5 doubling/h, the copy number (number of plasmids per genome equivalent of chromosomal DNA) decreased from 32 to 15, the number of plasmids per cell increased fro, 39 to 55, and the plasmid concentration decreased from 4.6 to 1.1x1010 plasmids per OD460 unit of cell mass. The concentrations of RNAI and RNAII also decreased with incrasing growth rate, but differently, such that their ratio, RNAI/RNAII, increased. In glycerol minimal medium both RNAI and RNAII had the same halflife, 0.55 min, and were synthesized at a ratio of about 3 RNAI transcripts per every RNAII transcript. These results were interpreted on the basis of the negative control model and suggest that the activities of the RNAI and RNAII promoters, and the efficiency with which RNAI inhibits plasmid replication, are controlled by the growth rate. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Two divergently transcribed operons in Escherichia coli required for the expression of fibronectin- and Congo red-binding curli polymers were identified and characterized by transposon mutagenesis, sequencing and transcriptional analyses, as well as for their ability to produce the curli subunit protein. The csgBA operon encodes CsgA, the major subunit protein of the fibre, and CsgB, a protein with sequence homology to CsgA. A non-polar csgB mutant is unaffected in its production of CsgA, but the subunit protein is not assembled into insoluble fibre polymers. A third open reading frame, orfC, positioned downstream of csgA may affect some functional property of curli since an insertion in this putative gene abolishes the autoagglutinating ability typical of curliated cells without affecting the production of the fibre. The promoter for the oppositely transcribed csgDEFG operon was identified by primer extension and shown, like the csgBA promoter, to be dependent upon the alternate stationary phase-specific sigma factor sigma s in wild-type cells, but not in mutants lacking the nucleoid associated protein H-NS. Insertions in csgD abolish completely trancription from the csgBA promoter. Therefore, any regulatory effect on the csgBA promoter might be secondary to events controlling the csgDEFG promoter and/or activation of CsgD. Insertions in csgE, csgF and csgG abolish curli formation but allow CsgA expression suggesting that one or more of these gene products are involved in secretion/assembly of the CsgA subunit protein. No amino acid sequence homologies were found between the CsgE, CsgF and CsgG proteins and secretion/assembly proteins for other known bacterial fibres, suggesting that the formation of curli follows a novel pathway.},

These conditions include cell growth in medium containing elevated levels of Mg2+, and incubation of the cells at 0°C in a solution of Mn2+, Ca2+, Rb+ or K+, dimethyl sulfoxide, dithiothreitol, and hexamine cobalt (III). Transformation efficiency declines linearly with increasing plasmid size. Relaxed and supercoiled plasmids transform with similar probabilities. Non-transforming DNAs compete consistent with mass. No significant variation is observed between competing DNAs of different source, complexity, length or form. Competition with both transforming and non-transforming plasmids indicates that each cell is capable of taking up many DNA molecules, and that the establishment of a transformation event is neither helped nor hindered significantly by the presence of multiple plasmids. {\textcopyright} 1983 Academic Press Inc.

They are also potentially valuable as transgenes for dominant diseases given that point mutations and/or small rearrangements can be accurately introduced. Here, we describe a new method to introduce small alterations in BACs, which results in the generation of point mutations with high frequency. The method involves homologous recombination between the original BAC and a shuttle vector providing the mutation. Each recombination step is monitored using positive and negative selection markers, which are the Kanamycin-resistance gene, the sacB gene and temperature-sensitive replication, all conferred by the shuttle plasmid. We have used this method to introduce four different point mutations and the insertion of the ss-galactosidase gene in a BAC, which has subsequently been used for transgenic animal production.},

However, in the noisy cellular environment, oscillations can be highly inaccurate due to phase fluctuations. It remains poorly understood how biochemical circuits suppress phase fluctuations and what is the incurred thermodynamic cost. Here, we study four different types of biochemical oscillations representing three basic oscillation motifs shared by all known oscillatory systems. We find that the phase diffusion constant follows the same inverse dependence on the free energy dissipation per period for all systems studied. This relationship between the phase diffusion and energy dissipation is shown analytically in a model of noisy oscillation. Microscopically, we find that the oscillation is driven by multiple irreversible cycles that hydrolyze the fuel molecules such as ATP; the number of phase coherent periods is proportional to the free energy consumed per period. Experimental evidence in support of this universal relationship and testable predictions are also presented.},

abstract = {A major goal of biology is to provide a quantitative description of cellular behaviour. This task, however, has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring protein abundances and their variation. Here we present a strategy that pairs high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged yeast strains to monitor rapidly and precisely protein levels at single-cell resolution. Bulk protein abundance measurements of {\textgreater}2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function. For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas those involved in protein synthesis are quiet. Thus, these studies reveal a remarkable structure to biological noise and suggest that protein noise levels have been selected to reflect the costs and potential benefits of this variation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Bacteria responds to changing chemical and thermal environment by moving towards or away from a particular location. In this report, we looked into thermal gradient generation and response of E. coli DH5$\alpha$ cells to thermal gradient in the presence and in the absence of spherical gold nanoparticles (size: 15 to 22 nm) in a static microfluidic environment using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) made microfluidic device. A PDMS-agarose based microfluidic device for generating thermal gradient has been developed and the thermal gradient generation in the device has been validated with the numerical simulation. Our studies revealed that the presence of gold nanoparticles, AuNPs (0.649 $\mu$g/mL) has no effect on the thermal gradient generation. The E. coli DH5$\alpha$ cells have been treated with AuNPs of two different concentrations (0.649 $\mu$g/mL and 0.008 $\mu$g/mL). The thermotaxis behavior of cells in the presence of AuNPs has been studied and compared to the thermotaxis of E.coli DH5$\alpha$ cells in the absence of AuNPs. In case of thermotaxis, in the absence of the AuNPs, the E. coli DH5$\alpha$ cells showed better thermotaxis towards lower temperature range, whereas in the presence of AuNPs (0.649 $\mu$g/mL and 0.008 $\mu$g/mL) thermotaxis of the E. coli DH5$\alpha$ cells has been inhibited. The results show that the spherical AuNPs intervenes in the themotaxis of E. coli DH5$\alpha$ cells and inhibits the cell migration. The reason for the failure in thermotaxis response mechanism may be due to decreased F-type ATP synthase activity and collapse of membrane potential by AuNPs, which, in turn, leads to decreased ATP levels. This has been hypothesized since both thermotaxis and chemotaxis follows the same response mechanism for migration in which ATP plays critical role.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing and chemotaxis both affect bacterial behavior on the population level. Chemotaxis shapes the spatial distribution of cells, while quorum sensing realizes a cell-density dependent gene regulation. An interesting question is if these mechanisms interact on some level: Does quorum sensing, a density dependent process, affect cell density itself via chemotaxis? Since quorum sensing often spans across species, such a feedback mechanism may also exist between multiple species. We constructed a microfluidic platform to study these questions. A flow-free, stable linear chemical gradient is formed in our device within a few minutes that makes it suitable for sensitive testing of chemoeffectors: we showed that the amino acid lysine is a weak chemoattractant for Escherichia coli, while arginine is neutral. We studied the effect of quorum sensing signal molecules of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on E. coli chemotaxis. Our results show that N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-homoserine lactone (oxo-C12-HSL) and N-(butryl)-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) are attractants. Furthermore, we tested the chemoeffector potential of pyocyanin and pyoverdine, secondary metabolites under a quorum sensing control.

abstract = {In order to gain deeper insight into the functions and dynamics of RNA in cells, the development of methods for imaging multiple RNAs simultaneously is of paramount importance. Here, we describe a modular approach to image RNA in living cells using an RNA aptamer that binds to dinitroaniline, an efficient general contact quencher. Dinitroaniline quenches the fluorescence of different fluorophores when directly conjugated to them via ethylene glycol linkers by forming a non-fluorescent intramolecular complex. Since the binding of the RNA aptamer to the quencher destroys the fluorophore-quencher complex, fluorescence increases dramatically upon binding. Using this principle, a series of fluorophores were turned into fluorescent turn-on probes by conjugating them to dinitroaniline. These probes ranged from fluorescein-dinitroaniline (green) to TexasReddinitroaniline (red) spanning across the visible spectrum. The dinitroaniline-binding aptamer (DNB) was generated by in vitro selection, and was found to bind all probes, leading to fluorescence increase in vitro and in living cells. When expressed in E. coli, the DNB aptamer could be labelled and visualized with different-coloured fluorophores and therefore it can be used as a genetically encoded tag to image target RNAs. Furthermore, combining contactquenched fluorogenic probes with orthogonal DNB (the quencher-binding RNA aptamer) and SRB-2 aptamers (a fluorophore-binding RNA aptamer) allowed dual-colour imaging of two different fluorescenceenhancing RNA tags in living cells, opening new avenues for studying RNA co-localization and trafficking.},

Such probes were initially developed by attaching optically "silent" fluorophores via enzyme-sensitive linkers to large copolymers of biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(amino acids). In diseased tissue, where the concentration of enzymes is high, the fluorophores are freed from the macromolecular carrier and regain their initial ability to fluoresce, thus allowing in vivo optical localization of the diseased tissue. This chapter describes the design and application of these probes and their alternatives in various areas of experimental medicine and gives an overview of currently available techniques that allow imaging of animals using visible and near-infrared light. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Growth-mediated feedback between synthetic gene circuits and host organisms leads to diverse emerged behaviors, including growth bistability and enhanced ultrasensitivity. However, the range of possible impacts of growth feedback on different gene circuits remains underexplored. Here, we mathematically and experimentally demonstrated that growth feedback affects the functions of memory gene circuits in a network topology-dependent way. Specifically, the memory of the self-activation circuit is quickly lost due to the fast growth-mediated dilution of the circuit products. Decoupling of growth feedback reveals its memory, manifested by its hysteresis property across a broad range of stimulus. On the contrary, the toggle switch is more refractory to the growth-mediated dilution and can retrieve its memory after the fast-growth phase. The underlying principle lies in the different dependence of active and repressive regulations in these circuits on the growth-mediated dilution. Our results unveil the topology-dependent mechanism on how growth-mediated feedback influences the behaviors of gene circuits.},

abstract = {The SOS genetic network is responsible for the repair/bypass of DNA damage in bacterial cells. While the initial stages of the response have been well characterized, less is known about the dynamics of the response after induction and its shutoff. To address this, we followed the response of the SOS network in living individual Escherichia coli cells. The promoter activity (PA) of SOS genes was monitored using fluorescent protein-promoter fusions, with high temporal resolution, after ultraviolet irradiation activation. We find a temporal pattern of discrete activity peaks masked in studies of cell populations. The number of peaks increases, while their amplitude reaches saturation, as the damage level is increased. Peak timing is highly precise from cell to cell and is independent of the stage in the cell cycle at the time of damage. Evidence is presented for the involvement of the umuDC operon in maintaining the pattern of PA and its temporal precision, providing further evidence for the role UmuD cleavage plays in effecting a timed pause during the SOS response, as previously proposed. The modulations in PA we observe share many features in common with the oscillatory behavior recently observed in a mammalian DNA damage response. Our results, which reveal a hitherto unknown modulation of the SOS response, underscore the importance of carrying out dynamic measurements at the level of individual living cells in order to unravel how a natural genetic network operates at the systems level. {\textcopyright} 2005 Friedman et al.},

abstract = {Synthetic genetic programs promise to enable novel applications in industrial processes. For such applications, the genetic circuits that compose programs will require fidelity in varying and complex environments. In this work, we report the performance of two synthetic circuits in Escherichia coli under industrially relevant conditions, including the selection of media, strain, and growth rate. We test and compare two transcriptional circuits: an AND and a NOR gate. In E. coli DH10B, the AND gate is inactive in minimal media; activity can be rescued by supplementing the media and transferring the gate into the industrial strain E. coli DS68637 where normal function is observed in minimal media. In contrast, the NOR gate is robust to media composition and functions similarly in both strains. The AND gate is evaluated at three stages of early scale-up: 100 mL shake flask experiments, a 1 mL MTP microreactor, and a 10 L bioreactor. A reference plasmid that constitutively produces a GFP reporter is used to make comparisons of circuit performance across conditions. The AND gate function is quantitatively different at each scale. The output deteriorates late in fermentation after the shift from exponential to constant feed rates, which induces rapid resource depletion and changes in growth rate. In addition, one of the output states of the AND gate failed in the bioreactor, effectively making it only responsive to a single input. Finally, cells carrying the AND gate show considerably less accumulation of biomass. Overall, these results highlight challenges and suggest modified strategies for developing and characterizing genetic circuits that function reliably during fermentation. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

We found that cyclic di-GMP in many bacterial species is sensed by a riboswitch class in messenger RNA that controls the expression of genes involved in numerous fundamental cellular processes. A variety of cyclic di-GMP regulons are revealed, including some riboswitches associated with virulence gene expression, pilus formation, and flagellum biosynthesis.

It has been proposed that to find these sites fast and accurately, TFs combine one-dimensional (1D) sliding on DNA with 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm. This facilitated diffusion mechanism has been demonstrated in vitro, but it has not been shown experimentally to be exploited in living cells. We have developed a single-molecule assay that allows us to investigate the sliding process in living bacteria. Here we show that the lac repressor slides 45 ± 10 base pairs on chromosomal DNA and that sliding can be obstructed by other DNA-bound proteins near the operator. Furthermore, the repressor frequently ({\textgreater}90{\%}) slides over its natural lacO1 operator several times before binding. This suggests a trade-off between rapid search on nonspecific sequences and fast binding at the specific sequence.},

We show that published protocols produce a template-independent product in addition to amplifying real target mRNA thus reducing the specific activity of the final product. We describe a modified amplification protocol that minimizes the generation of template-independent product and can therefore generate the desired microgram quantities of message-derived material from 100 ng of total RNA. Application of a second, nested round of cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription reduces the required starting material to 2 ng of total RNA.

@article{Mangan2003,
abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

abstract = {Strain engineering for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications often requires the expression of foreign proteins that can reduce cellular fitness. In order to quantify and visualize the evolutionary stability dynamics in engineered populations of Escherichia coli, we constructed randomized CMY (cyan-magenta-yellow) genetic circuits with independently randomized promoters, ribosome binding sites, and transcriptional terminators that express cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Using a CMY color system allows for a spectrum of different colors to be produced under UV light since the relative ratio of fluorescent proteins vary between circuits, and this system can be used for the visualization of evolutionary stability dynamics. Evolutionary stability results from 192 evolved populations (24 CMY circuits with 8 replicates each) indicate that both the number of repeated sequences and overall expression levels contribute to circuit stability. The most evolutionarily robust circuit has no repeated parts, lower expression levels, and is about 3-fold more stable relative to a rationally designed circuit. Visualization results show that evolutionary dynamics are highly stochastic between replicate evolved populations and color changes over evolutionary time are consistent with quantitative data. We also measured the competitive fitness of different mutants in an evolved population and find that fitness is highest in mutants that express a lower number of genes (0 and 1 {\textgreater} 2 {\textgreater} 3). In addition, we find that individual circuits with expression levels below 10{\%} of the maximum have significantly higher evolutionary stability, suggesting there may be a hypothetical "fitness threshold" that can be used for robust circuit design. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a deep-sea hydrocarbon plume that caused a shift in the indigenous microbial community composition with unknown ecological consequences. Early in the spill history, a bloom of uncultured, thus uncharacterized, members of the Oceanospirillales was previously detected, but their role in oil disposition was unknown. Here our aim was to determine the functional role of the Oceanospirillales and other active members of the indigenous microbial community using deep sequencing of community DNA and RNA, as well as single-cell genomics. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing revealed that genes for motility, chemotaxis and aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation were significantly enriched and expressed in the hydrocarbon plume samples compared with uncontaminated seawater collected from plume depth. In contrast, although genes coding for degradation of more recalcitrant compounds, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, total xylenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were identified in the metagenomes, they were expressed at low levels, or not at all based on analysis of the metatranscriptomes. Isolation and sequencing of two Oceanospirillales single cells revealed that both cells possessed genes coding for n-alkane and cycloalkane degradation. Specifically, the near-complete pathway for cyclohexane oxidation in the Oceanospirillales single cells was elucidated and supported by both metagenome and metatranscriptome data. The draft genome also included genes for chemotaxis, motility and nutrient acquisition strategies that were also identified in the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. These data point towards a rapid response of members of the Oceanospirillales to aliphatic hydrocarbons in the deep sea. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

Recent experimental work provides extensive evidence for a simple, quantitative size homeostasis principle coined adder (as opposed to sizer or timer). The adder principle provides unexpected insights into how bacteria maintain their size without employing a feedback mechanism. We review the genesis of adder and recent cell size homeostasis study on evolutionarily divergent bacterial organisms and beyond. We propose new coarse-grained approaches to understand the underlying mechanisms of cell size control at the whole cell level.},

abstract = {Genome editing appears poised to enter an exciting new era. Targeted double-stranded breaks due to custom restriction enzymes are powerful nucleating events for the induction of local changes in the genome. The zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) platform established the potential of this approach for the zebrafish, but access to high quality reagents has been a major bottleneck for the field. However, two groups recently report successful somatic and germline gene modification using a new nuclease architecture, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN construction is simpler, potentially more reliable, and in the few cases examined, shows fewer off-target effects than corresponding ZFNs. TALENs promise to bring gene targeting to the majority of zebrafish laboratories.},

abstract = {Recent progress in the field of synthetic biology has led to the creation of cells containing synthetic genomes. Although these first synthetic organisms contained copies of natural genomes, future work will be directed toward engineering of organisms with modified genomes and novel phenotypes. Much work, however, remains to be done to be able to routinely engineer novel biological functions. As a tool that will be useful for such purpose, we have recently developed a modular cloning system (MoClo) that allows high throughput assembly of multiple genetic elements. We present here new features of this cloning system that allow to increase the speed of assembly of multigene constructs. As an example, 68 DNA fragments encoding basic genetic elements were assembled using three one-pot cloning steps, resulting in a 50 kb construct containing 17 eukaryotic transcription units. This cloning system should be useful for generating the multiple construct variants that will be required for developing gene networks encoding novel functions, and fine-tuning the expression levels of the various genes involved.},

Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.

However, the global transcription patterns accompanying the lysogenic infection of E. coli host have not been clearly resolved. In this study, gene expression profiles of Stx2 phage phi Min27(delta stx::cat) converted and native E. coli MG1655 hosts were compared using microarray assay. The phi Min27(delta stx::cat) conversion had a direct effect on the global expression of bacterial host genes as 166 genes were found to be differentially expressed (104 up-regulated and 62 downregulated). These genes were predominantly responsible for bacterial central metabolism, transport and transcription. It was shown that in addition to the down-regulation of genes involved in synthesis of thiamine and protein transporters, expression of genes associated with bacterial energy production (e.g., fadABDEHIJL, aceK, and acnA) was also suppressed. Conversely, most up-regulated genes were transport genes, flagellar synthesis genes (fliDESTZ), and acid resistance genes (e.g., gadEW, hdeABD, and adiY). Futhermore, conversion of phi Min27(delta stx::cat) was shown to change physiological properties of the host cell. In comparison with the uninfected cells the converted bacteria host had increased acid tolerance and promoted swimming motility on a semisolid agar surface.},

To address this, we made use of synthetic transcriptional and translational elements to create a combinatorial library of constructs that modulated expression strength of a green fluorescent protein. Combining this library with a microbioreactor platform, we were able to perform a detailed large-scale assessment of transient expression and growth characteristics of two Escherichia coli strains across several temperatures. This revealed significant differences in the robustness of both strains to differing types of protein expression, and a complex response of transcriptional and translational elements to differing temperatures.

Particular emphasis is placed on identifying features that are expected to be conserved among different two-component proteins from those that are expected to differ, with the goal of defining the extent to which knowledge of previously characterized two-component proteins can be applied to newly discovered systems.},

abstract = {Synthetic genetic programs are built from circuits that integrate sensors and implement temporal control of gene expression. Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5′ untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the mRNA are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can reveal new genes and splice variants and quantify expression genome-wide in a single assay. The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

abstract = {Species' range expansions in response to climate change, and the invasion of exotic organisms, are two of the most pressing issues in ecology. Range expansions have already been documented in several taxa, including butterflies, grasshoppers and crickets, and birds, and as climate continues to change we can expect the ranges of many species to alter. Invasion of exotic organisms is of great interest currently because of the damage caused by many invasive species. Within a model, we find that during range expansion, selection generally favours individuals with a higher propensity for dispersal. This character change results in a more rapid spread than expected assuming evolutionary stasis. We show that Allee effects can slow invasion by reducing both selection for increased dispersal and chance of survival for propagules beyond the current range. Understanding how dispersal and other characters might evolve at expanding range margins is important not only for the prediction of range shifts in response to anthropogenic climate change, but also for understanding range shifting during previous natural climate change and for assessing the likely invasion dynamics of an introduced species.},

abstract = {Gene expression is an inherently noisy process. Fluctuations arise at many points in the expression of a gene, as all the salient reactions such as transcription, translation, and mRNA degradation are stochastic processes. The fluctuations become important when the cellular copy numbers of the relevant molecules (mRNA or proteins) are low. For regulated genes, a computational complication arises from the fact that protein synthesis rates depend on the concentrations of the transcription factors that regulate the corresponding genes. Because of the growing cell volume, such rates are effectively time-dependent. We deal with the effects of volume growth computationally using a rather simple method: the growth of the cell volume is incorporated in our simulations by stochastically adding small volume elements to the cell volume. As an application of this method we study a gene circuit with positive autoregulation that exhibits bistability. We show how the region of bistability becomes diminished by increasing the effect of noise via a reduced copy number of the regulatory protein. Cell volume determines the region of bistability for different noise strengths. The method is general and can also be applied to other cases where synthesis rates of proteins are regulated and an appropriate analytical description is difficult to achieve. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In classical evolutionary theory, traits evolve because they facilitate organismal survival and/or reproduction. We discuss a different type of evolutionary mechanism that relies upon differential dispersal. Traits that enhance rates of dispersal inevitably accumulate at expanding range edges, and assortative mating between fast-dispersing individuals at the invasion front results in an evolutionary increase in dispersal rates in successive generations. This cumulative process (which we dub "spatial sorting") generates novel phenotypes that are adept at rapid dispersal, irrespective of how the underlying genes affect an organism's survival or its reproductive success. Although the concept is not original with us, its revolutionary implications for evolutionary theory have been overlooked. A range of biological phenomena (e.g., acceleration of invasion fronts, insular flightlessness, preadaptation) may have evolved via spatial sorting as well as (or rather than) by natural selection, and this evolutionary mechanism warrants further study.},

abstract = {The diffusion coefficient of the transcription factor LacI within living Escherichia coli has been measured directly by in vivo tracking to be D=0.4$\mu$m2/s. At this rate, simple models of diffusion lead to the expectation that LacI and other proteins will rapidly homogenize throughout the cell. Here, we test this expectation of spatial homogeneity by single-molecule visualization of LacI molecules non-specifically bound to DNA in fixed cells. Contrary to expectation, we find that the distribution depends on the spatial location of its encoding gene. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of LacI is also determined by the local state of DNA compaction, and that E. coli can dynamically redistribute proteins by modifying the state of its nucleoid. Finally, we show that LacI inhomogeneity increases the strength with which targets located proximally to the LacI gene are regulated. We propose a model for intranucleoid diffusion that can reconcile these results with previous measurements of LacI diffusion, and we discuss the implications of these findings for gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} 2012 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Earlier studies have suggested that CheZ, the phosphatase of the signaling protein CheY in bacterial chemotaxis, may be in an oligomeric state both when bound to phosphorylated CheY (CheY approximately P) (Blat, Y., and Eisenbach, M. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 902-906) or free (Stock, A., and Stock, J. B. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 3301-3311). The purpose of the current study was to determine the oligomeric state of free CheZ and to investigate whether it changes upon binding to CheY approximately P. By using either one of two different sets of cross-linking agents, free CheZ was found to be a dimer. The formation of the dimer was specific, as it was prevented by SDS which does not interfere with cross-linking mediated by random collisions. The dimeric form of CheZ was confirmed by sedimentation analysis, a cross-linking-free technique. In the presence of CheY approximately P (but not in the presence of non-phosphorylated CheY), a high molecular size cross-linked complex (90-200 kDa) was formed, in which the CheZ:CheY ratio was 2:1. The size of the oligomeric complex was estimated by fluorescence depolarization to be 4-5-fold larger than the dimer, suggesting that its size is in the order of 200 kDa. These results indicate that CheZ oligomerizes upon interaction with CheY approximately P. This phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization may be a mechanism for regulating CheZ activity.},

We demonstrate that this library can be used to obtain highly accurate dynamic measurements of promoter activity on a genomic scale, in a glucose-lactose diauxic shift experiment.

abstract = {Our understanding of bacterial cell size control is based mainly on stress-free growth conditions in the laboratory [1–10]. In the real world, however, bacteria are routinely faced with stresses that produce long filamentous cell morphologies [11–28]. Escherichia coli is observed to filament in response to DNA damage [22–25], antibiotic treatment [11–14, 28], host immune systems [15, 16], temperature [17], starvation [20], and more [18, 19, 21], conditions which are relevant to clinical settings and food preservation [26]. This shape plasticity is considered a survival strategy [27]. Size control in this regime remains largely unexplored. Here we report that E. coli cells use a dynamic size ruler to determine division locations combined with an adder-like mechanism to trigger divisions. As filamentous cells increase in size due to growth, or decrease in size due to divisions, its multiple Fts division rings abruptly reorganize to remain one characteristic cell length away from the cell pole and two such length units away from each other. These rules can be explained by spatiotemporal oscillations of Min proteins. Upon removal of filamentation stress, the cells undergo a sequence of division events, randomly at one of the possible division sites, on average after the time required to grow one characteristic cell size. These results indicate that E. coli cells continuously keep track of absolute length to control size, suggest a wider relevance for the adder principle beyond the control of normally sized cells, and provide a new perspective on the function of the Fts and Min systems. Wehrens, Ershov, et al. report a new size-control mechanism in E. coli cells that have elongated due to stress. Multiple division rings are continuously rearranged in response to growth and division to control daughter cell size when divisions resume. Divisions are spatially controlled by the Min system and temporally by the adder principle.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that antibiotics can promote horizontal gene transfer. However, because of a variety of confounding factors that complicate the interpretation of previous studies, the mechanisms by which antibiotics modulate horizontal gene transfer remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether antibiotics directly regulate the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer, serve as a selection force to modulate population dynamics after such gene transfer has occurred, or both. Here, we address this question by quantifying conjugation dynamics in the presence and absence of antibiotic-mediated selection. Surprisingly, we find that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics from the most widely used classes do not significantly increase the conjugation efficiency. Instead, our modelling and experimental results demonstrate that conjugation dynamics are dictated by antibiotic-mediated selection, which can both promote and suppress conjugation dynamics. Our findings suggest that the contribution of antibiotics to the promotion of horizontal gene transfer may have been overestimated. These findings have implications for designing effective antibiotic treatment protocols and for assessing the risks of antibiotic use. H orizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a main contributor to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes 1–3 . Conversely, it has been generally assumed that antibiotics promote HGT 4,5 . One of the most common mechanisms for HGT, particularly for the transfer of plasmids such as those carrying antibiotic resistance, is conjugation 2,6,7 . There are two broad ways in which antibiotics can promote HGT via conjugation. First, when dosed at sublethal con-centrations, antibiotics can increase the conjugation rate by either activating the excision of transferrable genes from the host chromo-some or by inducing the expression of conjugation machinery (or both) 8–12 . Second, it has been speculated, but not proven, that anti-biotics can cause global cellular responses, such as changes in cell wall composition or upregulation of key survival genes 13,14 , which can indirectly increase the conjugation rate 15–17},

Using spatially extended arrays of microdroplets, we study the diffusion of both AHL and IPTG from inducer-filled reservoirs into bacteria-containing droplets, and also from droplets with AHL producing sender bacteria into neighboring droplets containing receiver cells. Computational modeling of gene expression dynamics within the droplets suggests a strongly reduced effective diffusion coefficient of the inducers, which markedly affects the spatial communication pattern in the neighborhood of the senders. Engineered bacteria that integrate AHL and IPTG signals with a synthetic AND gate gene circuit are shown to respond only in the presence of both types of sender droplets, which demonstrates the potential of the system for genetically programmed pattern formation and distributed computing.},

abstract = {Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels from renewable resources. Compared to the traditional biofuel, ethanol, higher alcohols offer advantages as gasoline substitutes because of their higher energy density and lower hygroscopicity. In addition, branched-chain alcohols have higher octane numbers compared with their straight-chain counterparts. However, these alcohols cannot be synthesized economically using native organisms. Here we present a metabolic engineering approach using Escherichia coli to produce higher alcohols including isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol from glucose, a renewable carbon source. This strategy uses the host's highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway and diverts its 2-keto acid intermediates for alcohol synthesis. In particular, we have achieved high-yield, high-specificity production of isobutanol from glucose. The strategy enables the exploration of biofuels beyond those naturally accumulated to high quantities in microbial fermentation. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Gene expression is a complex stochastic process composed of numerous enzymatic reactions with rates coupled to hidden cell-state variables. Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the lack of a theory accurately describing the gene expression process has restricted a robust, quantitative understanding of gene expression variability among cells. Here we present the Chemical Fluctuation Theorem (CFT), providing an accurate relationship between the environment-coupled chemical dynamics of gene expression and gene expression variability. Combined with a general, accurate model of environment-coupled transcription processes, the CFT provides a unified explanation of mRNA variability for various experimental systems. From this analysis, we construct a quantitative model of transcription dynamics enabling analytic predictions for the dependence of mRNA noise on the mRNA lifetime distribution, confirmed against stochastic simulation. This work suggests promising new directions for quantitative investigation into cellular control over biological functions by making complex dynamics of intracellular reactions accessible to rigorous mathematical deductions.},

abstract = {We have developed a simple and highly efficient method to disrupt chromosomal genes in Escherichia coli in which PCR primers provide the homology to the targeted gene(s). In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.},

abstract = {We have developed a protocol to assemble in one step and one tube at least nine separate DNA fragments together into an acceptor vector, with 90{\%} of recombinant clones obtained containing the desired construct. This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call 'Golden Gate shuffling', is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene.},

Ethanol fixation and enzymatic pretreatment with lysozyme and proteinase K were used to optimize whole cell hybridization of exponential phase and stationary phase Listeria spp. cells. In parallel, transcript probes carrying multiple digoxigenin molecules were combined with anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody fragments labeled with horseradish peroxidase to detect, via the catalytic deposition of fluorescein-tyramide, the iap-mRNA in single Listeria monocytogenes cells. The iap gene encodes the associated virulence factor p60. Application of the new signal amplification technique resulted in strong signals comparable in intensity to those obtained with fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.},

abstract = {Gene expression can be noisy, as can the growth of single cells. Such cell-to-cell variation has been implicated in survival strategies for bacterial populations. However, it remains unclear how single cells couple gene expression with growth to implement these strategies. Here, we show how noisy expression of a key stress-response regulator, RpoS, allows E. coli to modulate its growth dynamics to survive future adverse environments. We reveal a dynamic positive feedback loop between RpoS and growth rate that produces multi-generation RpoS pulses. We do so experimentally using single-cell, time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics and theoretically with a stochastic model. Next, we demonstrate that E. coli prepares for sudden stress by entering prolonged periods of slow growth mediated by RpoS. This dynamic phenotype is captured by the RpoS-growth feedback model. Our synthesis of noisy gene expression, growth, and survival paves the way for further exploration of functional phenotypic variability.},

We argue that this character- ization is incomplete and present a library of engineered promot- ers of varying strengths obtained through mutagenesis of a con- stitutive promoter. A multifaceted characterization of the library, especially at the single-cell level to ensure homogeneity, permitted quantitative assessment correlating the effect of gene expression levels to improved growth and product formation phenotypes in Escherichia coli. Integration of these promoters into the chromo- some can allow for a quantitative accurate assessment of genetic control. To this end,weused the characterized library of promoters to assess the impact of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase levels on growth yield and deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels on lycopene production. The multifaceted characterization of promoter strength enabled identification of optimal expression levels for ppc and dxs, which maximized the desired phenotype. Additionally, in a strain preengineered to produce lycopene, the response to deoxy-xylulose-P synthase levels was linear at all levels tested, indicative of a rate-limiting step, unlike the parental strain, which exhibited an optimum expression level, illustrating that optimal gene expression levels are variable and dependent on the genetic background of the strain. This promoter library concept is illus- trated as being generalizable to eukaryotic organisms (Saccharo- myces cerevisiae) and thus constitutes an integral platform for functional genomics, synthetic biology, and metabolic engineering endeavors.},

In the temporal domain, dynamical behaviors such as oscillations and pulses of protein production pervade cell biology, underlying phenomena as diverse as circadian rhythmicity, cell cycle control, stress and damage responses, and stem-cell pluripotency. In multicellular populations, spatial heterogeneities are crucial for decision making and development, among many other functions. Cells need to exquisitely coordinate this temporal and spatial variation to survive. Although the spatiotemporal character of gene expression is challenging to quantify experimentally at the level of individual cells, it is beneficial from the modeling viewpoint, because it provides strong constraints that can be probed by theoretically analyzing mathematical models of candidate gene and protein circuits. Here, we review recent examples of temporal dynamics and spatial patterning in gene expression to show how modeling such phenomenology can help us unravel the molecular mechanisms of cellular function.},

abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

To address this problem and to allow the purification of fluorescently tagged RNA complexes, we have selected a high affinity RNA aptamer called RNA Mango. This aptamer binds a series of thiazole orange (fluorophore) derivatives with nanomolar affinity, while increasing fluorophore fluorescence by up to 1,100-fold. Visualization of RNA Mango by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, together with injection and imaging of RNA Mango/fluorophore complex in C. elegans gonads demonstrates the potential for live-cell RNA imaging with this system. By inserting RNA Mango into a stem loop of the bacterial 6S RNA and biotinylating the fluorophore, we demonstrate that the aptamer can be used to simultaneously fluorescently label and purify biologically important RNAs. The high affinity and fluorescent properties of RNA Mango are therefore expected to simplify the study of RNA complexes. (Chemical Equation Presented).},

These properties, which include multistability and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits such as the bacteriophage lambda switch and the Cyanobacteria circadian oscillator. However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch-a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network-in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

@article{Iverson2016,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

These systems can be employed for a variety of purposes, ranging from producing compounds of industrial or therapeutic value, to reducing crop losses by altering cellular responses to pathogens or climate change. To realize the full potential of plant synthetic biology, techniques are required that provide control over the genetic code - enabling targeted modifications to DNA sequences within living plant cells. Such control is now within reach owing to recent advances in the use of sequence-specific nucleases to precisely engineer genomes.

abstract = {The coordination of cell growth and division is a long-standing problem in biology. Focusing on Escherichia coli in steady growth, we quantify cell division control using a stochastic model, by inferring the division rate as a function of the observable parameters from large empirical datasets of dividing cells. We find that (i) cells have mechanisms to control their size, (ii) size control is effected by changes in the doubling time, rather than in the single-cell elongation rate, (iii) the division rate increases steeply with cell size for small cells, and saturates for larger cells. Importantly, (iv) the current size is not the only variable controlling cell division, but the time spent in the cell cycle appears to play a role, and (v) common tests of cell size control may fail when such concerted control is in place. Our analysis illustrates the mechanisms of cell division control in E. coli. The phenomenological framework presented is sufficiently general to be widely applicable and opens the way for rigorous tests of molecular cell-cycle models.},

abstract = {A common approach to design genetic circuits is to compose gene expression cassettes together. While appealing, this modular approach is challenged by the fact that expression of each gene depends on the availability of transcriptional/translational resources, which is in turn determined by the presence of other genes in the circuit. This raises the question of how competition for resources by different genes affects a circuit's behavior. Here, we create a library of genetic activation cascades in E. coli bacteria, where we explicitly tune the resource demand by each gene. We develop a general Hill-function-based model that incorporates resource competition effects through resource demand coefficients. These coefficients lead to nonregulatory interactions among genes that reshape the circuit's behavior. For the activation cascade, such interactions result in surprising biphasic or monotonically decreasing responses. Finally, we use resource demand coefficients to guide the choice of ribosome binding site and DNA copy number to restore the cascade's intended monotonically increasing response. Our results demonstrate how unintended circuit's behavior arises from resource competition and provide a model-guided methodology to minimize the resulting effects.},

abstract = {Imaging RNA in living cells is a challenging problem in cell biology. One strategy for genetically encoding fluorescent RNAs is to express them as fusions with Spinach, an 'RNA mimic of GFP'. We found that Spinach was dimmer than expected when used to tag constructs in living cells owing to a combination of thermal instability and a propensity for misfolding. Using systematic mutagenesis, we generated Spinach2 that overcomes these issues and can be used to image diverse RNAs. Using Spinach2, we detailed the dynamics of the CGG trinucleotide repeat-containing 'toxic RNA' associated with Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, and show that these RNAs form nuclear foci with unexpected morphological plasticity that is regulated by the cell cycle and by small molecules. Together, these data demonstrate that Spinach2 exhibits improved versatility for fluorescently labeling RNAs in living cells. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.},

These logic circuits work in a manner similar to electronic logic circuits, but they are much more stochastic and hence much harder to characterize. In this article, we introduce an approach to analyze the threshold value and timing of genetic logic circuits. We show how this approach can be used to analyze the timing behavior of single and cascaded genetic logic circuits. We further analyze the timing sensitivity of circuits by varying the degradation rates and concentrations. Our approach can be used not only to characterize the timing behavior but also to analyze the timing constraints of cascaded genetic logic circuits, a capability that we believe will be important for design automation in synthetic biology.},

Here, we provide direct experimental evidence disproving the critical size paradigm. Instead, we show through single-cell microscopy and modeling that the evolutionarily distant bacteria Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus achieve cell size homeostasis by growing, on average, the same amount between divisions, irrespective of cell length at birth. This simple mechanism provides a remarkably robust cell size control without the need of being precise, abating size deviations exponentially within a few generations. This size homeostasis mechanism is broadly applicable for symmetric and asymmetric divisions, as well as for different growth rates. Furthermore, our data suggest that constant size extension is implemented at or close to division. Altogether, our findings provide fundamentally distinct governing principles for cell size and cell-cycle control in bacteria.},

Using microarray and gene fusion analyses, we demonstrate that at least five of the 29 GGDEF/EAL genes in Escherichia coli are not only stationary phase-induced under the control of the general stress response master regulator sigma(S) (RpoS), but also exhibit differential control by additional environmental and temporal signals. Two of the corresponding proteins, YdaM (GGDEF only) and YciR (GGDEF + EAL), which in vitro show DGC and PDE activity, respectively, play an antagonistic role in the expression of the biofilm-associated curli fimbriae. This control occurs at the level of transcription of the curli and cellulose regulator CsgD. Moreover, we show that H-NS positively affects curli expression by inversely controlling the expression of ydaM and yciR. Furthermore, we demonstrate a temporally fine-tuned GGDEF cascade in which YdaM controls the expression of another GGDEF protein, YaiC. By genome-wide microarray analysis, evidence is provided that YdaM and YciR strongly and nearly exclusively control CsgD-regulated genes. We conclude that specific GGDEF/EAL proteins have very distinct expression patterns, and when present in physiological amounts, can act in a highly precise, non-global and perhaps microcompartmented manner on a few or even a single specific target(s).},

However, the motor is ultrasensitive, with a narrow operating range of CheY-P concentrations6 complexes are coupled by the diffusible protein CheY-P. Receptor output (the steady-state concentrationofCheY-P) varies fromcell to cell5 . How thematch between receptor output and motor input might be optimized is unclear. Here we show that the motor can shift its operating range by changing its composition. The number of FliMsubunits in the C-ring increases in response to a decrement in the concentration of CheY-P, increas- ing motor sensitivity. This shift in sensitivity explains the slow partial adaptation observed in mutants that lack the receptor methyltransferase and methylesterase7,8 signal-dependent FliM turnover9 and why motors show . Adaptive remodelling is likely to be a common feature in the operation of many molecular machines},

abstract = {As climate change has become one of the major global risks, our heavy dependence on petroleum-derived fuels has received much public attention. To solve such problems, production of sustainable fuels has been intensively studied over the past years. Thanks to recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering technologies, bio-based platforms for advanced biofuels production have been developed using various microorganisms. The strategies for production of advanced biofuels have converged upon four major metabolic routes: the 2-ketoacid pathway, the fatty acid synthesis (FAS) pathway, the isoprenoid pathway, and the reverse $\beta$-oxidation pathway. Additionally, the polyketide synthesis pathway has recently been attracting interest as a promising alternative biofuel production route. In this article, recent trends in advanced biofuels production are reviewed by categorizing them into three types of advanced biofuels: alcohols, biodiesel and jet fuel, and gasoline. Focus is given on the strategies of employing synthetic biology and metabolic engineering for the development of microbial strains producing advanced fuels. Finally, the prospects for future advances needed to achieve much more efficient bio-based production of advanced biofuels are discussed, focusing on designing advanced biofuel production pathways coupled with screening, modifying, and creating novel enzymes.},

abstract = {A challenge of synthetic biology is the creation of cooperative microbial systems that exhibit population-level behaviors. Such systems use cellular signaling mechanisms to regulate gene expression across multiple cell types. We describe the construction of a synthetic microbial consortium consisting of two distinct cell types—an “activator” strain and a “repressor” strain. These strains produced two orthogonal cell-signaling molecules that regulate gene expression within a synthetic circuit spanning both strains. The two strains generated emergent, population-level oscillations only when cultured together. Certain network topologies of the two-strain circuit were better at maintaining robust oscillations than others. The ability to program population-level dynamics through the genetic engineering of multiple cooperative strains points the way toward engineering complex synthetic tissues and organs with multiple cell types.},

abstract = {To perform well in biotechnology applications, synthetic genetic oscillators must be engineered to allow independent modulation of amplitude and period. This need is currently unmet. Here, we demonstrate computationally how two classic genetic oscillators, the dual-feedback oscillator and the repressilator, can be re-designed to provide independent control of amplitude and period and improve tunability—that is, a broad dynamic range of periods and amplitudes accessible through the input “dials.” Our approach decouples frequency and amplitude modulation by incorporating an orthogonal “sink module” where the key molecular species are channeled for enzymatic degradation. This sink module maintains fast oscillation cycles while alleviating the translational coupling between the oscillator's transcription factors and output. We characterize the behavior of our re-designed oscillators over a broad range of physiologically reasonable parameters, explain why this facilitates broader function and control, and provide general design principles for building synthetic genetic oscillators that are more precisely controllable.

abstract = {When musing about evolution, the physician and scientific essayist Lewis Thomas wrote, “The capacity to blunder slightly is the real marvel of DNA. Without this special attribute, we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music” (1). Understanding how DNA mutations arise in cells, either spontaneously or after damage, has been a central question for scientists since the discovery of the structure of DNA over six decades ago. Since that time, significant progress on defining how DNA is damaged by processes external and internal to the cell has been made. Furthermore, several DNA repair pathways have been investigated at the molecular level and have been shown to reverse these genomic injuries, often including feedback mechanisms that up-regulate repair once severe damage is detected. In recognition of this significant mechanistic research in the field of genome stability, two important prizes were awarded in 2015: the Lasker Award to Stephen Elledge and Evelyn Witkin, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar. Mismatch repair (MMR), worked out in detail by Modrich (2) and his colleagues, is comparable to the backspace button on our computers to correct typing errors. This process, conserved through all kingdoms of life, acts to eliminate replication errors that occur when a DNA polymerase places the wrong nucleotide triphosphate opposite its appropriate template or opposite a damaged nucleobase, diminishing DNA replication fidelity. The newly synthesized strand is marked by its temporary lack of methylation and it is this feature that allows MMR to fix the newly introduced errors. In Escherichia coli , MMR is mediated by three key proteins: MutS, MutL, and MutH. MutS recognizes the mismatch and loads multiple copies of MutL next to the lesion. These molecules translocate along the DNA to locate the MutH endonuclease, which is {\ldots}

abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

@article{Jensen1990,
abstract = {In this paper, the Escherichia coli cell is considered as a system desgned for rapid growth, but limited by the medium. We propose that this very design causes the cell to become subsaturated with precursors and catalytic components at all levels of macromolecular biosynthesis and leads to a molecular sharing economy at a high level of competition inside the cell. Thus, the promoters compete with each other in the binding of a limited amount of free RNA polymerase and the ribosome binding sites on the mRNA chains compete with each other for the free ribosomes. The macromolecular chain elongation reactions sequester a considerable proportion of the total amount of RNA polymerase and ribosomes in the cells. We propose that the degree of subsaturation of the macromolecular biosynthetic apparatus renders a variable fraction of RNA polymerase and ribosomes unavailable for the initiation of new chain synthesis and that this, at least in part, determines the composition of the cell as function of the growth rate. Thus, at rapid growth, the high speed of the elongation reactions enables the cell to increase the concentrations of free RNA polymerase and ribosomes for initiation purposes. Furthermore, it is proposed that the speed of RNA polymerase movement is adjusted to the performance speed of the ribosomes. Mechanistically, this adjustment of the coupling between transcription and translation involves transcriptional pause sites along the RNA chains, the adjustment of the saturation level of RNA polymerase with the nucleoside triphosphate substrates, and the concentration of ppGpp, which is known to inhibit RNA chain elongation. This model is able to explain the stringent response and the control of stable RNA and of ribosome synthesis in steady states and in shifts, as well as the rate of overall protein synthesis as a function of the growth rate.},

abstract = {Background: Global analysis of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome is facilitated by the recent development of tools for large-scale, highly parallel analysis. We describe a novel nucleic acid amplification system that generates products by several methods. 3′-Ribo-SPIA™ primes cDNA synthesis at the 3′ polyA tail, and whole transcript (WT)-Ribo-SPIA primes cDNA synthesis across the full length of the transcripts and thus provides whole-transcriptome amplification, independent of the 3′ polyA tail. Methods: We developed isothermal linear nucleic acid amplification systems, which use a single chimeric primer, for amplification of DNA (SPIA) and RNA (Ribo-SPIA). The latter allows mRNA amplification from as little as 1 ng of total RNA. Amplification efficiency was calculated based on the delta threshold cycle between nonamplified cDNA targets and amplified cDNA. The amounts and quality of total RNA and amplification products were determined after purification of the amplification products. GeneChip{\textregistered} array gene expression profiling and real-time PCR were used to test the accuracy and reproducibility of the method. Quantification of cDNA products (before and after amplification) at the 2 loci along the transcripts was used to assess product length (for evaluation of the 3′-initiated Ribo-SPIA) and equal representation throughout the length of the transcript (for evaluation of the whole transcript amplification system, WT-Ribo-SPIA™). Results: Ribo-SPIA-based global RNA amplification exhibited linearity over 6 orders of magnitude of transcript abundance and generated microgram amounts of amplified cDNA from as little as 1 ng of total RNA. Conclusions: The described methods enable comprehensive gene expression profiling and analysis from limiting biological samples. The WT-Ribo-SPIA procedure, which enables amplification of non-polyA-tailed RNA, is suitable for amplification and gene expression analysis of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic biological samples. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

Digital images of SYBR Gold-stained viral particles were processed to enumerate the concentration of viral particles by using digital image analysis software. Estimates of viral concentration based on digitized images were 1.3 times higher than those based on direct counting by epifluorescence microscopy. Direct epifluorescence counts of SYBR Gold-stained viral particles were in turn about 1.34 times higher than those estimated by the transmission electron microscope method. Bacteriophage lysates stained with SYBR Gold formed a distinct population in flow cytometric signatures. Flow cytometric analysis revealed at least four viral subpopulations for a Lake Erie sample and two subpopulations for a Georgia coastal sample. Flow cytometry-based viral counts for various types of samples averaged 1.1 times higher than direct epifluorescence microscopic counts. The potential application of digital image analysis and flow cytometry for rapid and accurate measurement of viral abundance in aquatic environments is discussed.},

Thanks to the advantages of light, optogenetics has emerged as an ideal technology for this task. Current state-of-the-art methods for optical expression control fail to combine precision with repeatability and cannot withstand changing operating culture conditions. Here, we present a novel fully automatic experimental platform for the robust and precise long-term optogenetic regulation of protein production in liquid Escherichia coli cultures. Using a computer-controlled light-responsive two-component system, we accurately track prescribed dynamic green fluorescent protein expression profiles through the application of feedback control, and show that the system adapts to global perturbations such as nutrient and temperature changes. We demonstrate the efficacy and potential utility of our approach by placing a key metabolic enzyme under optogenetic control, thus enabling dynamic regulation of the culture growth rate with potential applications in bacterial physiology studies and biotechnology.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNAs of {\~{}}22 nucleotides, which can negatively regulate gene expression through induction of mRNA degradation and/or post-transcriptional gene silencing. MiRNAs are key factors in the regulation of many biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Since miRNAs are known to be in close association with cancer development, non-invasive imaging of miRNA expression and/or activity is of critical importance, for which conventional molecular biology techniques are not suitable or applicable. Over the last several years, various molecular imaging techniques have been investigated for imaging of miRNAs. In this review article, we summarize the current state-of-the-art imaging of miRNAs, which are typically based on fluorescent proteins, bioluminescent enzymes, molecular beacons, and/or various nanoparticles. Non-invasive imaging of miRNA expression and/or biological activity is still at its infancy. Future research on more clinically relevant, non-toxic techniques is required to move the field of miRNA imaging into clinical applications. Non-invasive imaging of miRNA is an invaluable method that can not only significantly advance our understandings of a wide range of human diseases, but also lead to new and more effective treatment strategies for these diseases.},

abstract = {Bacterial surface motility, such as swarming, is commonly examined in the laboratory using plate assays that necessitate specific concentrations of agar and sometimes inclusion of specific nutrients in the growth medium. The preparation of such explicit media and surface growth conditions serves to provide the favorable conditions that allow not just bacterial growth but coordinated motility of bacteria over these surfaces within thin liquid films. Reproducibility of swarm plate and other surface motility plate assays can be a major challenge. Especially for more “temperate swarmers” that exhibit motility only within agar ranges of 0.4{\%}-0.8{\%} (wt/vol), minor changes in protocol or laboratory environment can greatly influence swarm assay results. “Wettability”, or water content at the liquid-solid-air interface of these plate assays, is often a key variable to be controlled. An additional challenge in assessing swarming is how to quantify observed differences between any two (or more) experiments. Here we detail a versatile two-phase protocol to prepare and image swarm assays. We include guidelines to circumvent the challenges commonly associated with swarm assay media preparation and quantification of data from these assays. We specifically demonstrate our method using bacteria that express fluorescent or bioluminescent genetic reporters like green fluorescent protein (GFP), luciferase (lux operon), or cellular stains to enable time-lapse optical imaging. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to track competing swarming species in the same experiment.},

As this new method only requires simple DNA preparation and one-step yeast transformation, it represents a powerful tool in the construction of biochemical pathways for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and functional genomics studies.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in rates of gene expression can produce highly erratic time patterns of protein production in individual cells and wide diversity in instantaneous protein concentrations across cell populations. When two independently produced regulatory proteins acting at low cellular concentrations competitively control a switch point in a pathway, stochastic variations in their concentrations can produce probabilistic pathway selection, so that an initially homogeneous cell population partitions into distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Many pathogenic organisms, for example, use this mechanism to randomly switch surface features to evade host responses. This coupling between molecular-level fluctuations and macroscopic phenotype selection is analyzed using the phage $\lambda$ lysis-lysogeny decision circuit as a model system. The fraction of infected cells selecting the lysogenic pathway at different phage:cell ratios, predicted using a molecular-level stochastic kinetic model of the genetic regulatory circuit, is consistent with experimental observations. The kinetic model of the decision circuit uses the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, stochastic mechanisms of gene expression, and a statistical-thermodynamic model of promoter regulation. Conventional deterministic kinetics cannot be used to predict statistics of regulatory systems that produce probabilistic outcomes. Rather, a stochastic kinetic analysis must be used to predict statistics of regulatory outcomes for such stochastically regulated systems.},

abstract = {Membrane and secretory protein production in Escherichia coli requires precisely controlled production rates to avoid the deleterious saturation of their biogenesis pathways. On the basis of this requirement, the E. coli l-rhamnose PBAD promoter (PrhaBAD) is often used for membrane and secretory protein production since PrhaBAD is thought to regulate protein production rates in an l-rhamnose concentration-dependent manner. By monitoring protein production in real-time in E. coli wild-type and an l-rhamnose catabolism deficient mutant, we demonstrate that the l-rhamnose concentration-dependent tunability of PrhaBAD-mediated protein production is actually due to l-rhamnose consumption rather than regulating production rates. Using this information, a RhaT-mediated l-rhamnose transport and l-rhamnose catabolism deficient double mutant was constructed. We show that this mutant enables the regulation of PrhaBAD-based protein production rates in an l-rhamnose concentration-dependent manner and that this is critical to optimize membrane and secretory protein production yields. The high precision of protein production rates provided by the PrhaBAD promoter in an l-rhamnose transport and catabolism deficient background could also benefit other applications in synthetic biology.},

It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels).

abstract = {The bilin prosthetic groups of the phytochrome photoreceptors and the light-harvesting phycobiliprotein antennae arise from the oxygen-dependent ring opening of heme. Two ferredoxin-dependent enzymes contribute to this conversion: a heme oxygenase and a bilin reductase with discrete double-bond specificity. Using a dual plasmid system, one expressing a truncated cyanobacterial apophytochrome 1, Cph1(N514), and the other expressing a two-gene operon consisting of a heme oxygenase and a bilin reductase, these studies establish the feasibility of producing photoactive phytochromes in any heme-containing cell. Heterologous expression systems for phytochromes not only will facilitate genetic analysis of their assembly, spectrophotometric activity, and biological function, but also might afford the means to regulate gene expression by light in nonplant cells.},

In principle, differences in cell phenotypes that result from the RNA-guided modulation of transcription levels by dCas9 are critical for inferring with gene function; however, the effect of intracellular dCas9 expression on bacterial morphology has not been systematically elucidated. Here, we observed unexpected morphological changes in Escherichia coli mediated by dCas9, which were then characterized using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Growth rates were severely decreased, to approximately 50{\%} of those of wild type cells, depending on the expression levels of dCas9.

The CRISPR-Cas system offers simple and powerful tools for this purpose. However, these CRISPR-Cas-based tools for activating user-defined genes are unable to offer precise temporal control of gene expression, despite the fact that many biological phenomena are regulated by highly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Here we created a light-inducible, user-defined, endogenous gene activation system based on CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system can allow rapid and reversible targeted gene activation by light. In addition, using this system, we have exemplified photoactivation of multiple user-defined endogenous genes in mammalian cells. The present CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system offers simple and versatile approaches for precise endogenous gene activation in basic biological research and biotechnology applications.},

abstract = {It has been shown experimentally that competition for limited translational resources by upstream mRNAs can lead to an anticorrelation between protein counts. Here, we investigate a stochastic model for this phenomenon, in which gene transcripts of different types compete for a finite pool of ribosomes. Throughout, we utilize concepts from the theory of multiclass queues to describe a qualitative shift in protein count statistics as the system transitions from being underloaded (ribosomes exceed transcripts in number) to being overloaded (transcripts exceed ribosomes in number). The exact analytical solution of a simplified stochastic model, in which the numbers of competing mRNAs and ribosomes are fixed, exhibits weak positive correlations between steady-state protein counts when total transcript count slightly exceeds ribosome count, whereas the solution can exhibit strong negative correlations when total transcript count significantly exceeds ribosome count. Extending this analysis, we find approximate but reasonably accurate solutions for a more realistic model, in which abundances of mRNAs and ribosomes are allowed to fluctuate randomly. Here, ribosomal fluctuations contribute positively and mRNA fluctuations contribute negatively to correlations, and when mRNA fluctuations dominate ribosomal fluctuations, a strong anticorrelation extremum reliably occurs near the transition from the underloaded to the overloaded regime. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

But as models of reality, they are only useful if we have realistic parameters for the molecular reaction rates and cell physiological processes. There is currently no suitable framework to reliably estimate hundreds, let alone thousands, of reaction rate parameters. Here, we map out the relative weaknesses and promises of different approaches aimed at redressing this issue. While suitable procedures for estimation or inference of the whole (vast) set of parameters will, in all likelihood, remain elusive, some hope can be drawn from the fact that much of the cellular behaviour may be explained in terms of smaller sets of parameters. Identifying such parameter sets and assessing their behaviour is now becoming possible even for very large systems of equations, and we expect such methods to become central tools in the development and analysis of whole-cell models.},

abstract = {AIMS: To determine the underlying substrate utilization mechanism in the logistic equation for batch microbial growth by revealing the relationship between the logistic and Monod kinetics. Also, to determine the logistic rate constant in terms of Monod kinetic constants. METHODS AND RESULTS: The logistic equation used to describe batch microbial growth was related to the Monod kinetics and found to be first-order in terms of the substrate and biomass concentrations. The logistic equation constant was also related to the Monod kinetic constants. Similarly, the substrate utilization kinetic equations were derived by using the logistic growth equation and related to the Monod kinetics. CONCLUSION: It is revaled that the logistic growth equation is a special form of the Monod growth kinetics when substrate limitation is first-order with respect to the substrate concentration. The logistic rate constant (k) is directly proportional to the maximum specific growth rate constant (mu(m)) and initial substrate concentration (S(0)) and also inversely related to the saturation constant (K(s)). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The semi-empirical logistic equation can be used instead of Monod kinetics at low substrate concentrations to describe batch microbial growth using the relationship between the logistic rate constant and the Monod kinetic constants.},

abstract = {Temperate phages may choose to infect either through the lytic or the lysogenic cycles 1 . Whereas the lytic cycle leads to lysis of the bacte­ rial cell, in the lysogenic cycle the phage genome integrates into the bacterial genome, and the lysogenized bacterium becomes immune to further infection by the same phage 1 . In accordance, growth dynamics of bacteria infected by temperate phages presents partial, but not full, lysis of the culture, followed by culture recovery due to growth of lyso­ genized bacteria. The factors influencing lysis–lysogeny decisions have so far been studied in depth mainly for the bacteriophage Lambda, which infects Escherichia coli 2 . The decision was shown to be probabilistic in nature, but influenced by the nutritional state of the infected bacterium as well as by the number of co­infecting phage particles 2,3 . In the current study we report that phages that infect Bacillus species can rely on small­ molecule communication to execute lysis–lysogeny decisions. Conditioned media promote phi3T lysogeny We initiated this study by attempting to test the hypothesis, which was consequently not verified, that bacteria secrete communication mole­ cules to alert other bacteria of phage infection. For this, we prepared conditioned media from cultures of Bacillus subtilis strain 168 infected by four different phages: phi29, phi105, rho14 and phi3T (Fig. 1a). To prepare these conditioned media, we infected bacteria growing at mid­ log phase with the phage at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, and collected the conditioned media three hours after infection (or without infection, for control media). The collected media were finely filtered to retrieve small molecules and eliminate remaining bacteria and phages, and a fresh batch of bacteria was added to the conditioned and control media and subsequently infected by the same phage (Fig. 1a). For phi3T, the infection dynamics in the conditioned medium, as inferred from the bacterial growth curve, was markedly different to the dynamics in the control medium. Whereas a substantial fraction of the infected bacterial culture had lysed in the control medium two hours after infection, the culture grown in the conditioned medium appeared to be more protected from lysis (Fig. 1b). This effect was not detected for any of the other three phages we tested, for which we did not observe a difference in infection dynamics between the control and conditioned media (Extended Data Fig. 1). Moreover, the conditioned medium prepared from phi3T infection did not affect the infection dynamics of other phages, and conditioned media prepared from other phages did not affect the infection dynamics of phi3T (Extended Data Fig. 1). These results imply that a small molecule is released to the medium during infection of B. subtilis by phi3T and this molecule can affect infection dynamics of downstream infections by this phage. Quorum sensing in Bacilli and other Firmicutes is typically based on short peptides that are secreted into the medium and sensed by intra­cellular or membrane­bound receptors 4–6},

The mechanism used by the enzyme in recognizing the origin is unknown, but minus strand replication requires the holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase. The origin contains two inverted repeats which can form hairpins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When the origin sequence is drawn arranging the two hairpins horizontally, it resembles a stretch of a mostly double-stranded molecule. The nucleotides protected from nucleases by the holoenzyme were found to be located in two regions on this drawing: one around the 35th nucleotide upstream of the RNA start site, and the other ranging from the 10th nucleotide upstream to the 10th downstream, of the start site. The core enzyme did not show any protection. Mutational analyses of the origin indicated that the base-paired structure in the former region was important for origin activity. In the region around the 10th nucleotide upstream of the start site, specific base(s) in the non-template strand were required for origin activity, while the base sequence of the template strand was irrelevant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the recognition mechanism of the origin by RNA polymerase shares common features with that of transcriptional promoters.},

abstract = {The ribosome's interactions with mRNA govern its translation rate and the effects of post-transcriptional regulation. Long, structured 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) are commonly found in bacterial mRNAs, though the physical mechanisms that determine how the ribosome binds these upstream regions remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically investigate the ribosome's interactions with structured standby sites, upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and show that these interactions can modulate translation initiation rates by over 100-fold. We find that an mRNA's translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for 136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple standby site modules. The model predicts and experiments confirm that the ribosome can readily bind distant standby site modules that support high translation rates, providing a physical mechanism for observed context effects and long-range post-transcriptional regulation.},

Understanding how the homeostasis of cellular size and composition is accomplished by different organisms is an outstanding challenge in biology. For exponentially growing Escherichia coli cells, it is long known that the size of cells exhibits a strong positive relation with their growth rates in different nutrient conditions. Here, we characterized cell sizes in a set of orthogonal growth limitations. We report that cell size and mass exhibit positive or negative dependences with growth rate depending on the growth limitation applied. In particular, synthesizing large amounts of "useless" proteins led to an inversion of the canonical, positive relation, with slow growing cells enlarged 7- to 8-fold compared to cells growing at similar rates under nutrient limitation. Strikingly, this increase in cell size was accompanied by a 3- to 4-fold increase in cellular DNA content at slow growth, reaching up to an amount equivalent to ∼8 chromosomes per cell. Despite drastic changes in cell mass and macromolecular composition, cellular dry mass density remained constant. Our findings reveal an important role of protein synthesis in cell division control.},

abstract = {Bio-production of chemicals is an important driver of the societal transition toward sustainability. However, fermentations with heavily engineered production organisms can be challenging to scale to industrial volumes. Such fermentations are subject to evolutionary pressures that select for a wide range of genetic variants that disrupt the biosynthetic capacity of the engineered organism. Synthetic product addiction that couples high-yield production of a desired metabolite to expression of nonconditionally essential genes could offer a solution to this problem by selectively favoring cells with biosynthetic capacity in the population without constraining the medium. We constructed such synthetic product addiction by controlling the expression of two nonconditionally essential genes with a mevalonic acid biosensor. The product-addicted production organism retained high-yield mevalonic acid production through 95 generations of cultivation, corresponding to the number of cell generations required for {\textgreater}200-m3 industrial-scale production, at which time the nonaddicted strain completely abolished production. Using deep DNA sequencing, we find that the product-addicted populations do not accumulate genetic variants that compromise biosynthetic capacity, highlighting how synthetic networks can be designed to control genetic population heterogeneity. Such synthetic redesign of evolutionary forces with endogenous processes may be a promising concept for realizing complex cellular designs required for sustainable bio-manufacturing.},

abstract = {The system of the bacterium Escherichia coli and its virus, bacteriophage lambda, is paradigmatic for gene regulation in cell-fate development, yet insight about its mechanisms and complexities are limited due to insufficient resolution of study. Here we develop a 4-colour fluorescence reporter system at the single-virus level, combined with computational models to unravel both the interactions between phages and how individual phages determine cellular fates. We find that phages cooperate during lysogenization, compete among each other during lysis, and that confusion between the two pathways occasionally occurs. Additionally, we observe that phage DNAs have fluctuating cellular arrival times and vie for resources to replicate, enabling the interplay during different developmental paths, where each phage genome may make an individual decision. These varied strategies could separate the selection for replication-optimizing beneficial mutations during lysis from sequence diversification during lysogeny, allowing rapid adaptation of phage populations for various environments.},

abstract = {During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before division, after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise and thus requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions. We show that a subset of cells in a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a simple law governing cell-size control - a noisy linear map - explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later. Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological processes involved.},

Signals are programmed using an intuitive web tool named Iris. All components can be purchased for under {\$}400 and the device can be assembled and calibrated by a non-expert in one day.

We have shown previously that Apl represses both the lysogenic promoter, pL, and the major lytic promoter, pR, and is required for excision of the prophage. Apl binds at two locations on the phage chromosome, i.e. between pR and pL and at the phage-attachment site. Using an in vivo recombination assay, we now show that the role of Apl in excision is in the process itself and is not simply a consequence of repression of pR or pL. To study the repressive role of Apl at the switch promoters we isolated Apl-resistant operator mutants and used them to demonstrate a requirement for Apl in the efficient derepression of the lysogenic promoter during prophage induction. We conclude that Apl is both an excisionase and transcriptional repressor.},

abstract = {Throughout the decades of its history, the advances in bacteria-based bio-industries have coincided with great leaps in strain engineering technologies. Recently unveiled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) systems are now revolutionizing biotechnology as well as biology. Diverse technologies have been derived from CRISPR/Cas systems in bacteria, yet the applications unfortunately have not been actively employed in bacteria as extensively as in eukaryotic organisms. A recent trend of engineering less explored strains in industrial microbiology—metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and other related disciplines—is demanding facile yet robust tools, and various CRISPR technologies have potential to cater to the demands. Here, we briefly review the science in CRISPR/Cas systems and the milestone inventions that enabled numerous CRISPR technologies. Next, we describe CRISPR/Cas-derived technologies for bacterial strain development, including genome editing and gene expression regulation applications. Then, other CRISPR technologies possessing great potential for industrial applications are described, including typing and tracking of bacterial strains, virome identification, vaccination of bacteria, and advanced antimicrobial approaches. For each application, we note our suggestions for additional improvements as well. In the same context, replication of CRISPR/Cas-based chromosome imaging technologies developed originally in eukaryotic systems is introduced with its potential impact on studying bacterial chromosomal dynamics. Also, the current patent status of CRISPR technologies is reviewed. Finally, we provide some insights to the future of CRISPR technologies for bacterial systems by proposing complementary techniques to be developed for the use of CRISPR technologies in even wider range of applications.},

abstract = {So far, several DNA assembly standards have been developed, enabling scientists to conveniently share and modify characterized DNA parts. However, a majority of the restriction endonucleases used in these standards bear short recognition sites (e.g., 6 bps in BioBrick standard), which are widely distributed and need to be removed before further construction, causing much inconvenience. Although homing endonucleases, which recognize long DNA sequences, can be used for DNA assembly (e.g., iBrick standard), long scars will be left between parts, limiting their application. Here, we introduce a new DNA assembly standard, namely C-Brick, which employs the newly identified class 2 type V CRISPR-Cas systems protein Cpf1 endonuclease. C-Brick integrates both advantages of long recognition sites and short scars. With C-Brick standard, three chromoprotein cassettes were assembled and further expressed in Escherichia coli, producing colorful pigments. Moreover, C-Brick standard is also partially compatible with the BglBrick and BioBrick standards.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli K-12 has the ability to migrate on semisolid media by means of swarming motility. A systematic and comprehensive collection of gene-disrupted E. coli K-12 mutants (the Keio collection) was used to identify the genes involved in the swarming motility of this bacterium. Of the 3,985 nonessential gene mutants, 294 were found to exhibit a strongly repressed-swarming phenotype. Further, 216 of the 294 mutants displayed no significant defects in swimming motility; therefore, the 216 genes were considered to be specifically associated with the swarming phenotype. The swarming-associated genes were classified into various functional categories, indicating that swarming is a specialized form of motility that requires a wide variety of cellular activities. These genes include genes for tricarboxylic acid cycle and glucose metabolism, iron acquisition, chaperones and protein-folding catalysts, signal transduction, and biosynthesis of cell surface components, such as lipopolysaccharide, the enterobacterial common antigen, and type 1 fimbriae. Lipopolysaccharide and the enterobacterial common antigen may be important surface-acting components that contribute to the reduction of surface tension, thereby facilitating the swarm migration in the E. coli K-12 strain.},

abstract = {How cells control their size and maintain size homeostasis is a fundamental open question. Cell-size homeostasis has been discussed in the context of two major paradigms: "sizer," in which the cell actively monitors its size and triggers the cell cycle once it reaches a critical size, and "timer," in which the cell attempts to grow for a specific amount of time before division. These paradigms, in conjunction with the "growth law" [1] and the quantitative bacterial cell-cycle model [2], inspired numerous theoretical models [3-9] and experimental investigations, from growth [10, 11] to cell cycle and size control [12-15]. However, experimental evidence involved difficult-to-verify assumptions or population-averaged data, which allowed different interpretations [1-5, 16-20] or limited conclusions [4-9]. In particular, population-averaged data and correlations are inconclusive as the averaging process masks causal effects at the cellular level. In this work, we extended a microfluidic "mother machine" [21] and monitored hundreds of thousands of Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis cells under a wide range of steady-state growth conditions. Our combined experimental results and quantitative analysis demonstrate that cells add a constant volume each generation, irrespective of their newborn sizes, conclusively supporting the so-called constant $\Delta$ model. This model was introduced for E. coli [6, 7] and recently revisited [9], but experimental evidence was limited to correlations. This "adder" principle quantitatively explains experimental data at both the population and single-cell levels, including the origin and the hierarchy of variability in the size-control mechanisms and how cells maintain size homeostasis.},

abstract = {Programmable control of the cell cycle has been shown to be a powerful tool in cell-biology studies. Here, we develop a novel system for controlling the bacterial cell cycle, based on binding of CRISPR/dCas9 to the origin-of-replication locus. Initiation of replication of bacterial chromosomes is accurately regulated by the DnaA protein, which promotes the unwinding of DNA atoriC We demonstrate that the binding of CRISPR/dCas9 to any position within origin or replication blocks the initiation of replication. Serial-dilution plating, single-cell fluorescence microscopy, and flow-cytometry experiments show that ongoing rounds of chromosome replication are finished upon CRISPR/dCas9 binding, but no new rounds are initiated. Upon arrest, cells stay metabolically active and accumulate cell mass. We find that elevating the temperature from 37 to 42°C releases the CRISR/dCas9 replication inhibition, and we use this feature to recover cells from the arrest. Our simple and robust method of controlling the bacterial cell cycle is a useful asset for synthetic biology and DNA-replication studies in particular. The inactivation of CRISPR/dCas9 binding at elevated temperatures may furthermore be of wide interest for CRISPR/Cas9 applications in genomic engineering.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are functional mRNA that control gene expression. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) binds to thi-box riboswitch RNA and allosterically inhibits genes that code for proteins involved in the biosynthesis and transport of thiamine. Thiamine binding to the pyrimidine sensor helix and pyrophosphate binding to the pyrophosphate sensor helix cause changes in RNA conformation that regulate gene expression. Here we examine the thermodynamic properties of the internal loop of the pyrophosphate binding domain by comparing the wild-type construct (RNA WT) with six modified 2 x 2 bulged RNA and one 2 x 2 bulged DNA. The wild-type construct retains five conserved bases of the pyrophosphate sensor domain, two of which are in the 2 x 2 bulge (C65 and G66). The RNA WT construct was among the most stable (DeltaG degrees (3)(7) = -7.7 kcal/mol) in 1 M KCl at pH 7.5. Breaking the A*G mismatch of the bulge decreases the stability of the construct {\~{}}0.5-1 kcal/mol, but does not affect magnesium binding to the RNA WT. Guanine at position 48 is important for RNA-Mg(2)+ interactions of the TPP-binding riboswitch at pH 7.5. In the presence of 9.5 mM magnesium at pH 5.5, the bulged RNA constructs gained an average of 1.1 kcal/mol relative to 1 M salt. Formation of a single A+*C mismatch base pair contributes about 0.5 kcal/mol at pH 5.5, whereas two tandem A+*C mismatch base pairs together contribute about 2 kcal/mol.},

abstract = {Genetic circuits aredesigned to implement certain logic in living cells, keeping burden on the host cell minimal. However, manipulating the genome often will have a significant impact for various reasons (usage of the cell machinery to express new genes, toxicity of genes, interactions with native genes, etc.). In this work we utilize Koopman operator theory to construct data-driven models of transcriptomic-level dynamics from noisy and temporally sparse RNAseq measurements. We show how Koopman models can be used to quantify impact on genetic circuits. We consider an experimental example, using high-Throughput RNAseq measurements collected from wild-Type E. coli, single gate components transformed in E. coli, and a NAND circuit composed from individual gates in E. coli, to explore how Koopman subspace functions encode increasing circuit interference on E. coli chassis dynamics. The algorithm provides a novel method for quantifying the impact of synthetic biological circuits on host-chassis dynamics.},

Under the same doctrine of precision medicine, there is an equally important need to visualize these diseased cells to enable diagnosis, facilitate surgical resection, and monitor therapeutic response. Therefore, there is a great opportunity for chemists to develop chemically tractable probes that can image cancer in vivo. This review focuses on recent advances in the development of optical probes, as well as their current and future applications in the clinical management of cancer. The progress in probe development described here suggests that optical imaging is an important and rapidly developing field of study that encourages continued collaboration among chemists, biologists, and clinicians to further refine these tools for interventional surgical imaging, as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Microbiologists traditionally study population rather than individual cells, as it is generally assumed that the status of individual cells will be similar to that observed in the population. However, the recent studies have shown that the individual behavior of each single cell could be quite different from that of the whole population, suggesting the importance of extending traditional microbiology studies to single-cell level. With recent technological advances, such as flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and microspectroscopy, single-cell microbiology has greatly enhanced the understanding of individuality and heterogeneity of microbes in many biological systems. Notably, the application of multiple 'omics' in single-cell analysis has shed light on how individual cells perceive, respond, and adapt to the environment, how heterogeneity arises under external stress and finally determines the fate of the whole population, and how microbes survive under natural conditions. As single-cell analysis involves no axenic cultivation of target microorganism, it has also been demonstrated as a valuable tool for dissecting the microbial 'dark matter.' In this review, current state-of-the-art tools and methods for genomic and transcriptomic analysis of microbes at single-cell level were critically summarized, including single-cell isolation methods and experimental strategies of single-cell analysis with NGS. In addition, perspectives on the future trends of technology development in the field of single-cell analysis was also presented.},

abstract = {Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination are efficient, simple to use, and flexible, but have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein. We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called 'Golden Gate' cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.},

Terpenoids, a class of isoprenoids often isolated from plants, are used as commercial flavor and fragrance compounds and antimalarial or anticancer drugs. Because plant tissue extractions typically yield low terpenoid concentrations, we sought an alternative method to produce high-value terpenoid compounds, such as the antimalarial drug artemisinin, in a microbial host. We engineered the expression of a synthetic amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene and the mevalonate isoprenoid pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Escherichia coli. Concentrations of amorphadiene, the sesquiterpene olefin precursor to artemisinin, reached 24 microg caryophyllene equivalent/ml. Because isopentenyl and dimethylallyl pyrophosphates are the universal precursors to all isoprenoids, the strains developed in this study can serve as platform hosts for the production of any terpenoid compound for which a terpene synthase gene is available.},

It is, however, now commonly accepted that the choice of a normalization procedure is an important step in such a process, for example in differential gene expression analysis. The present article highlights the similarities between three normalization methods: TMM from edgeR R package, RLE from DESeq2 R package, and MRN. Both TMM and DESeq2 are widely used for differential gene expression analysis. This paper introduces properties that show when these three methods will give exactly the same results. These properties are proven mathematically and illustrated by performing in silico calculations on a given RNA-Seq data set.},

abstract = {The ability to monitor drug release in vivo provides essential pharmacological information. We developed a new modular approach for the preparation of theranostic prodrugs with a turn-ON near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence mode of action. The prodrugs release their chemotherapeutic cargo and an active cyanine fluorophore upon reaction with a specific analyte. The prodrug platform is based on the fluorogenic dye QCy7; upon removal of a triggering substrate, the dye fluoresces, and the free drug is released. The evaluated camptothecin prodrug was activated by endogenous hydrogen peroxide produced in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Drug release and in vitro cytotoxicity were correlated with the emitted fluorescence. The prodrug activation was effectively imaged in real time in mice bearing tumors. The modular design of the QCy7 fluorogenic platform should allow the preparation of numerous other prodrugs with various triggering substrates and chemotherapeutic agents. We anticipate that the development of real-time in vivo monitoring tools such as that described herein will pave the way for personalized therapy.},

abstract = {c-di-GMP riboswitches are structured RNAs located in the 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) of mRNAs that regulate expression of downstream genes in response to changing concentrations of the second messenger c-di-GMP. We discovered three complete c-di-GMP riboswitches (Bc3, Bc4 and Bc5 RNA) with similar structures, which are arranged in tandem to constitute a triple-tandem (Bc3-5 RNA) riboswitch in the 5'-UTR of the cspABCDE mRNA in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. chinensis CT-43. Our results showed that this natural triple-tandem riboswitch controlled the expression of the reporter gene more stringently and digitally than the double-tandem or single riboswitch. A sandwich-like dual-fluorescence reporter was further constructed by fusing the Bc3-5 RNA gene between the two fluorescence protein genes amcyan and turborfp. This reporter strain was found to exhibit detectable fluorescence color changes under bright field in response to intracellular c-di-GMP level altered by induced expression of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) PleD. Using this system, two putative membrane-bound DGCs from B. thuringiensis and Xanthomonas oryzae were verified to be functional by replacing pleD with the corresponding DGC genes. This report represented the first native triple-tandem riboswitch that was applied to serve as a riboswitch-based dual-fluorescence reporter for the efficient and convenient verification of putative DGC activity in vivo.},

abstract = {Differential responses to stimuli can affect how cells succumb to disease. In yeast, DNA damage can create heterogeneous responses. To delineate how a response contributes to a cell's future behavior, we constructed a transcription-based memory circuit that detects DNA repair to isolate subpopulations with heritable damage responses. Strongly responsive cells show multigenerational effects, including growth defects and iron-associated gene expression. Less-responsive cells exhibit increased mutation frequencies but resume wild-type behavior. These two subpopulations remain distinct for multiple generations, indicating a transmissible memory of damage. Collectively, this work demonstrates the efficacy of using synthetic biology to define how environmental exposure contributes to distinct cell fates. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {New therapeutic strategies are needed to treat infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, which constitute a major growing threat to human health. Here, we use a high-throughput technology to identify combinatorial genetic perturbations that can enhance the killing of drug-resistant bacteria with antibiotic treatment. This strategy, Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), enables the rapid generation of high-order barcoded combinations of genetic elements for high-throughput multiplexed characterization based on next-generation sequencing. We created ∼ 34,000 pairwise combinations of Escherichia coli transcription factor (TF) overexpression constructs. Using Illumina sequencing, we identified diverse perturbations in antibiotic-resistance phenotypes against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Specifically, we found multiple TF combinations that potentiated antibiotic killing by up to 10(6)-fold and delivered these combinations via phagemids to increase the killing of highly drug-resistant E. coli harboring New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. Moreover, we constructed libraries of three-wise combinations of transcription factors with {\textgreater}4 million unique members and demonstrated that these could be tracked via next-generation sequencing. We envision that CombiGEM could be extended to other model organisms, disease models, and phenotypes, where it could accelerate massively parallel combinatorial genetics studies for a broad range of biomedical and biotechnology applications, including the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections.},

abstract = {When E. coli cells express unneeded protein, they grow more slowly. Such penalty to fitness associated with making proteins is called protein cost. Protein cost is an important component in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underlie the evolution of protein circuits, but its origins are still poorly understood. Here, we ask how the protein cost varies during the exponential growth phase of E. coli. We find that cells growing exponentially following an upshift from overnight culture show a large cost when producing unneeded proteins. However, after several generations, while still in exponential growth, the cells enter a phase where cost is much reduced despite vigorous unneeded protein production. We find that this reduced-cost phase depends on the ppGpp system, which adjusts the amount of ribosomes in the cell and does not occur after a downshift from rich to poor medium. These findings suggest that protein cost is a transient phenomenon that happens upon an upshift in conditions and that cost is reduced when ribosomes and other cellular systems have increased to their appropriate steady-state level in the new condition. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To what extent are evolutionary outcomes determined by a population's recent environment, and to what extent do they depend on historical contingency and random chance? Here we apply a unique experimental system to investigate evolutionary reproducibility and path dependence at the protein level. We combined phage-assisted continuous evolution with high-throughput sequencing to analyze evolving protein populations as they adapted to divergent and then convergent selection pressures over hundreds of generations. Independent populations of T7 RNA polymerase genes were subjected to one of two selection histories ("pathways") demanding recognition of distinct intermediate promoters followed by a common final promoter. We observed distinct classes of solutions with unequal phenotypic activity and evolutionary potential evolve from the two pathways, as well as from replicate populations exposed to identical selection conditions. Mutational analysis revealed specific epistatic interactions that explained the observed path dependence and irreproducibility. Our results reveal in molecular detail how protein adaptation to different environments, as well as stochasticity among populations evolved in the same environment, can both generate evolutionary outcomes that preclude subsequent convergence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent climatic oscillations have produced dramatic changes in species distributions. This process has been proposed to be a major evolutionary force, shaping many life history traits of species, and to govern global patterns of biodiversity at different scales. During range expansions selection may favor the evolution of higher dispersal, and symbiotic interactions may be affected. It has been argued that a weakness of climate fluctuation-driven range dynamics at equatorial latitudes has facilitated the persistence there of more specialized species and interactions. However, how much the biology and ecology of species is changed by range dynamics has seldom been investigated, particularly in equatorial regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied a three-species symbiosis endemic to coastal equatorial rainforests in Cameroon, where the impact of range dynamics is supposed to be limited, comprised of two species-specific obligate mutualists--an ant-plant and its protective ant--and a species-specific ant parasite of this mutualism. We combined analyses of within-species genetic diversity and of phenotypic variation in a transect at the southern range limit of this ant-plant system. All three species present congruent genetic signatures of recent gradual southward expansion, a result compatible with available regional paleoclimatic data. As predicted, this expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of more dispersive traits in the two ant species. In contrast, we detected no evidence of change in lifetime reproductive strategy in the tree, nor in its investment in food resources provided to its symbiotic ants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the decreasing investment in protective workers and the increasing investment in dispersing females by both the mutualistic and the parasitic ant species, there was no evidence of destabilization of the symbiosis at the colonization front. To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence at equatorial latitudes that biological traits associated with dispersal are affected by the range expansion dynamics of a set of interacting species.},

@article{Poran2017,
abstract = {Pathogens have to balance transmission with persistence. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent malaria parasite, persistence within its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells, while its mosquito-borne transmission depends on intra-erythrocytic differentiation into non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes. Commitment to either fate is determined during the preceding cell cycle that begins with invasion by a single, asexually committed merozoite and ends, 48 hours later, with a schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, all committed to either continued asexual replication or differentiation into gametocytes. Sexual commitment requires the transcriptional activation of ap2-g (PF3D7-1222600), the master regulator of sexual development, from an epigenetically silenced state during asexual replication. AP2-G expression during this 'commitment cycle' prepares gene expression in nascent merozoites to initiate sexual development through a hitherto unknown mechanism. To maintain a persistent infection, the expression of ap2-g is limited to a sub-population of parasites (1-30{\%}, depending on genetic background and growth conditions). As sexually committed schizonts comprise only a sub-population and are morphologically indistinguishable from their asexually committed counterparts, defining their characteristic gene expression has been difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling. Here we use highly parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing of malaria cultures undergoing sexual commitment to determine the transcriptional changes induced by AP2-G within this sub-population. By analysing more than 18,000 single parasite transcriptomes from a conditional AP2-G knockdown line and NF54 wild-type parasites at multiple stages of development, we show that sexually committed, AP2-G+ mature schizonts specifically upregulate additional regulators of gene expression, including other AP2 transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes, and regulators of nucleosome positioning. These epigenetic regulators may act to facilitate the expression and/or repression of genes that are necessary for the initiation of gametocyte development in the subsequent cell cycle.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were compared as a function of steady-state external pH. Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium buffered at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 8.7. For each of the three pH conditions, cDNA from RNA of five independent cultures was hybridized to Affymetrix E. coli arrays. Analysis of variance with an alpha level of 0.001 resulted in 98{\%} power to detect genes showing a twofold difference in expression. Normalized expression indices were calculated for each gene and intergenic region (IG). Differential expression among the three pH classes was observed for 763 genes and 353 IGs. Hierarchical clustering yielded six well-defined clusters of pH profiles, designated Acid High (highest expression at pH 5.0), Acid Low (lowest expression at pH 5.0), Base High (highest at pH 8.7), Base Low (lowest at pH 8.7), Neutral High (highest at pH 7.0, lower in acid or base), and Neutral Low (lowest at pH 7.0, higher at both pH extremes). Flagellar and chemotaxis genes were repressed at pH 8.7 (Base Low cluster), where the cell's transmembrane proton potential is diminished by the maintenance of an inverted pH gradient. High pH also repressed the proton pumps cytochrome o (cyo) and NADH dehydrogenases I and II. By contrast, the proton-importing ATP synthase F1Fo and the microaerophilic cytochrome d (cyd), which minimizes proton export, were induced at pH 8.7. These observations are consistent with a model in which high pH represses synthesis of flagella, which expend proton motive force, while stepping up electron transport and ATPase components that keep protons inside the cell. Acid-induced genes, on the other hand, were coinduced by conditions associated with increased metabolic rate, such as oxidative stress. All six pH-dependent clusters included envelope and periplasmic proteins, which directly experience external pH. Overall, this study showed that (i) low pH accelerates acid consumption and proton export, while coinducing oxidative stress and heat shock regulons; (ii) high pH accelerates proton import, while repressing the energy-expensive flagellar and chemotaxis regulons; and (iii) pH differentially regulates a large number of periplasmic and envelope proteins.},

Advancements in continuous microbe culturing and selection design have facilitated the development of new technologies that enable the continuous directed evolution of proteins and nucleic acids. These technologies have the potential to support the extremely rapid evolution of biomolecules with tailor-made functional properties. Continuous evolution methods must support all of the key steps of laboratory evolution - translation of genes into gene products, selection or screening, replication of genes encoding the most fit gene products, and mutation of surviving genes - in a self-sustaining manner that requires little or no researcher intervention. Continuous laboratory evolution has been historically used to study problems including antibiotic resistance, organismal adaptation, phylogenetic reconstruction, and host-pathogen interactions, with more recent applications focusing on the rapid generation of proteins and nucleic acids with useful, tailor-made properties. The advent of increasingly general methods for continuous directed evolution should enable researchers to address increasingly complex questions and to access biomolecules with more novel or even unprecedented properties.},

Here, however, we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined, sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier.

Here we used phylogenetically directed cell separation by fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry, followed by amplification and sequencing of a fraction of the genomic DNA of several bacterial cells that belong to the TM7 phylum. Partial genomic assembly allowed, for the first time, a look into the evolution and potential metabolism of a soil representative from this group of organisms for which there are no species in stable laboratory cultures. Genomic reconstruction from targeted cells of uncultured organisms isolated directly from the environment represents a powerful approach to access any specific members of a community and an alternative way to assess the community's metabolic potential.

abstract = {The generation of novel secondary metabolites by reengineering or refactoring biochemical pathways is a rewarding but also challenging goal of synthetic biology. For this, the development of tools for the reconstruction of secondary metabolite gene clusters as well as the challenge of understanding the obstacles in this process is of great interest. The artificial gene operon assembly system (AGOS) is a plug-and-play method developed as a tool to consecutively assemble artificial gene operons into a destination vector and subsequently express them under the control of a de-repressed promoter in a Streptomyces host strain. AGOS was designed as a set of entry plasmids for the construction of artificial gene operons and a SuperCos1 based destination vector, into which the constructed operons can be assembled by Red/ET-mediated recombination. To provide a proof-of-concept of this method, we disassembled the well-known novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster into four gene operons, encoding for the different moieties of novobiocin. We then genetically reorganized these gene operons with the help of AGOS to finally obtain the complete novobiocin gene cluster again. The production of novobiocin precursors and of novobiocin could successfully be detected by LC−MS and LC−MS/MS. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the omission of terminator sequences only had a minor impact on product formation in our system.},

abstract = {Two bacterial strains, B-5(T) and NO1A, were isolated from the surface water of the Bohai Sea and deep-sea sediment of the east Pacific Ocean, respectively. Both strains were halophilic, aerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, catalase- and oxidase-positive motile rods. They grew on a restricted spectrum of organic compounds, including some organic acids and alkanes. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strains B-5(T) and NO1A were shown to belong to the gamma-Proteobacteria. Highest similarity values were found with Alcanivorax venustensis (95.2 {\%}), Alcanivorax jadensis (94.6 {\%}) and Alcanivorax borkumensis (94.1 {\%}). Principal fatty acids of both strains were C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)omega7c and C(18 : 1)omega7c. The chemotaxonomically characteristic fatty acid C(19 : 0) cyclo omega8c was also detected. On the basis of the above, together with results of physiological and biochemical tests, DNA-DNA hybridization, comparisons of 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer sequences and comparisons of the partial deduced amino acid sequence of alkane hydroxylase, both strains were affiliated to the genus Alcanivorax but were differentiated from recognized Alcanivorax species. Therefore, a novel species, Alcanivorax dieselolei sp. nov., represented by strains B-5(T) and NO1A is proposed, with the type strain B-5(T) (=DSM 16502(T)=CGMCC 1.3690(T)).},

abstract = {Synthetic biology seeks to envision living cells as a matter of engineering. However, increasing evidence suggests that the genetic load imposed by the incorporation of synthetic devices in a living organism introduces a sort of unpredictability in the design process. As a result, individual part characterization is not enough to predict the behavior of designed circuits and thus, a costly trial-error process is eventually required. In this work, we provide a new theoretical framework for the predictive treatment of the genetic load. We mathematically and experimentally demonstrate that dependences among genes follow a quantitatively predictable behavior. Our theory predicts the observed reduction of the expression of a given synthetic gene when an extra genetic load is introduced in the circuit. The theory also explains that such dependence qualitatively differs when the extra load is added either by transcriptional or translational modifications. We finally show that the limitation of the cellular resources for gene expression leads to a mathematical formulation that converges to an expression analogous to the Ohm's law for electric circuits. Similitudes and divergences with this law are outlined. Our work provides a suitable framework with predictive character for the design process of complex genetic devices in synthetic biology.},

Such an environment leads to considerable intercellular variability in circuit behaviour, which can hinder functionality at the colony level. Here we engineer the synchronization of thousands of oscillating colony 'biopixels' over centimetre-length scales through the use of synergistic intercellular coupling involving quorum sensing within a colony and gas-phase redox signalling between colonies. We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period. Given the repertoire of sensing capabilities of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the ability to coordinate their behaviour over large length scales sets the stage for the construction of low cost genetic biosensors that are capable of detecting heavy metals and pathogens in the field.},

abstract = {Proteases are important targets for the treatment of human disease. Several protease inhibitors have failed in clinical trials due to a lack of in vivo specificity, indicating the need for studies of protease function and inhibition in complex, disease-related models. The tight post-translational regulation of protease activity complicates protease analysis by traditional proteomics methods. Activity-based protein profiling is a powerful technique that can resolve this issue. It uses small-molecule tools—activity-based probes—to label and analyze active enzymes in lysates, cells, and whole animals. Over the last twelve years, a wide variety of protease activity-based probes have been developed. These synthetic efforts have enabled techniques ranging from real-time in vivo imaging of protease activity to high-throughput screening of uncharacterized proteases. This Review introduces the general principles of activity-based protein profiling and describes the recent advancements in probe design and analysis techniques, which have increased the knowledge of protease biology and will aid future protease drug discovery.},

abstract = {Synthetic gene circuits perturb the physiology of their cellular host. The extra load on endogenous processes shifts the equilibrium of resource allocation in the host, leading to slow growth and reduced biosynthesis. Here we built integrated host-circuit models to quantify growth defects caused by synthetic gene circuits. Simulations reveal a complex relation between circuit output and cellular capacity for gene expression. For weak induction of heterologous genes, protein output can be increased at the expense of growth defects. Yet for stronger induction, cellular capacity reaches a tipping point, beyond which both gene expression and growth rate drop sharply. Extensive simulations across various growth conditions and large regions of the design space suggest that the critical capacity is a result of ribosomal scarcity. We studied the impact of growth defects on various gene circuits and transcriptional logic gates, which highlights the extent to which cellular burden can limit, shape, and even break down circuit function. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework to assess the impact of host-circuit interactions in silico, with wide-ranging implications for the design and optimization of bacterial gene circuits.},

abstract = {The selection of data collection locations is a problem that has received significant research attention from classical design of experiments to various recent active learning algorithms. Typical objectives are to map an unknown function, optimize it, or find level sets in it. Each of these objectives focuses on an assess-ment of individual points. The introduction of set kernels has led to algorithms that in-stead consider labels assigned to sets of data points. In this paper we combine these two concepts and consider the problem of choos-ing data collection locations when the goal is to identify regions whose set of collected data would be labeled positively by a set clas-sifier. We present an algorithm for the case where the positive class is defined in terms of a region's average function value being above some threshold with high probability, a prob-lem we call active area search. To this end, we model the latent function using a Gaussian process and use Bayesian quadrature to esti-mate its integral on predefined regions. Our method is the first which directly solves the active area search problem. In experiments it outperforms previous algorithms that were developed for other active search goals.},

abstract = {Chaperones are protein complexes that help to fold and disaggregate a cell's proteins. It is not understood how four major chaperone systems of Escherichia coli work together in proteostasis: the recognition, sorting, folding, and disaggregating of the cell's many different proteins. Here, we model this machine. We combine extensive data on chaperoning, folding, and aggregation rates with expression levels of proteins and chaperones measured at different growth rates. We find that the proteostasis machine recognizes and sorts a client protein based on two biophysical properties of the client's misfolded state (M state): its stability and its kinetic accessibility from its unfolded state (U state). The machine is energy-efficient (the sickest proteins use the most ATP-expensive chaperones), comprehensive (it can handle any type of protein), and economical (the chaperone concentrations are just high enough to keep the whole proteome folded and disaggregated but no higher). The cell needs higher chaperone levels in two situations: fast growth (when protein production rates are high) and very slow growth (to mitigate the effects of protein degradation). This type of model complements experimental knowledge by showing how the various chaperones work together to achieve the broad folding and disaggregation needs of the cell.},

E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) has been recognized as one of the most effective solubilizing agents, having frequently been observed to improve the yield, enhance the solubility, and promote the proper folding of its fusion partners. The use of a dual hexahistidine-maltose-binding protein affinity tag (His(6)-MBP) has the additional advantage of allowing the fusion protein to be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) instead of or in addition to amylose affinity chromatography. This chapter describes a generic method for the overproduction of combinatorially tagged His(6)-MBP fusion proteins in E. coli, with particular emphasis on the use of recombinational cloning to construct expression vectors. In addition, simple methods for evaluating the solubility of the fusion protein and the passenger protein after it is cleaved from the dual His(6)-MBP tag are presented.},

Although a variety of relatively small gene circuits have been constructed and characterized, their logical combination into larger networks remains a central challenge. This is due primarily to the lack of compatible and orthogonal elements for predictable dynamic control of gene expression. As an alternative approach to promoter-level regulation, we explored the use of DNA copy number as a circuit control element. We engineered colony-wide DNA cycling in Escherichia coli in the form of plasmid copy number oscillations via a modular design that can be readily adapted for use with other gene circuitry. Copy number modulation is a generalizable principle that adds a layer of control to synthetic gene circuits, allowing dynamic regulation of circuit elements without requiring specially engineered promoters.},

Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis.},

It has been observed that under competing gradients of an attractant and temperature, the nutrient gradient (gradient generated by cells itself) initiates directed migration, which, in turn, is influenced by temperature through the metabolic rate. Exposure to competing gradients of an inhibitor and temperature leads to the imposed chemical gradient governing the directed cell migration.

abstract = {A terminal stage in the duplication of many bacterial plasmids involves the transient formation of catenated molecules containing two interlocked monomeric plasmid units. This property of plasmid replication was exploited to examine the relationship between F replication and the division cycle of Escherichia coli B/r cells growing in undisturbed, exponential-phase cultures. Various cultures of F′lac- or FKmr-containing cells were briefly exposed to [3H]thymidine, and then the transfer of radioactivity into, and out of, a catenated dimer consisting of two closed circular monomers was measured during a chase period. The fraction of plasmid molecules present in this dimer form was determined by separating cellular DNA in alkaline sucrose gradients. In addition, plasmid replication was studied in synchronously growing cultures by measuring both [3H]thymidine incorporation into covalently closed circular DNA and $\beta$-galactosidase inducibility. The results suggest that replication of F plasmids can take place throughout the cell division cycle, with the probability of replication increasing toward the end of the cycle. The presence of DNA homologous to the chromosome on the F′lac did not alter the replication pattern of the plasmid during the division cycle. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Biosynthesis enables renewable production of manifold compounds, yet often biosynthetic performance must be improved for it to be economically feasible. Nongenetic, cell-to-cell variations in protein and metabolite concentrations are naturally inherent, suggesting the existence of both high- and low-performance variants in all cultures. Although having an intrinsic source of low performers might cause suboptimal ensemble biosynthesis, the existence of high performers suggests an avenue for performance enhancement. Here we develop in vivo population quality control (PopQC) to continuously select for high-performing, nongenetic variants. We apply PopQC to two biosynthetic pathways using two alternative design principles and demonstrate threefold enhanced production of both free fatty acid (FFA) and tyrosine. We confirm that PopQC improves ensemble biosynthesis by selecting for nongenetic high performers. Additionally, we use PopQC in fed-batch FFA production and achieve 21.5 g l-1 titer and 0.5 g l-1 h-1 productivity. Given the ubiquity of nongenetic variation, PopQC should be applicable to a variety of metabolic pathways for enhanced biosynthesis.},

abstract = {A classic problem in microbiology is that bacteria display two types of growth behavior when cultured on a mixture of two carbon sources: the two sources are sequentially consumed one after another (diauxie) or they are simultaneously consumed (co-utilization). The search for the molecular mechanism of diauxie led to the discovery of the lac operon. However, questions remain as why microbes would bother to have different strategies of taking up nutrients. Here we show that diauxie versus co-utilization can be understood from the topological features of the metabolic network. A model of optimal allocation of protein resources quantitatively explains why and how the cell makes the choice. In case of co-utilization, the model predicts the percentage of each carbon source in supplying the amino acid pools, which is quantitatively verified by experiments. Our work solves a long-standing puzzle and provides a quantitative framework for the carbon source utilization of microbes.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells sharing an environment can display markedly different phenotypes. It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance, external signals, or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic programs. By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations under constant conditions, we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary, motile state and a chained, sessile state in Bacillus subtilis. We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We used cheZ mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, which had been isolated by Sockett et al. (Sockett, H., Yamaguchi, S., Kihara, M., Irikura, V. M., and Macnab, R. M. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 793-806), for cloning the mutant cheZ genes, overexpressing and purifying their products. We then measured the phosphatase activity, binding to CheY and to phosphorylated CheY (CheY approximately P), and CheY approximately P dependent oligomerization of the mutant CheZ proteins. While all the mutant proteins were defective in their phosphatase activity, they bound to CheY and CheY approximately P as well as wild-type CheZ. However, unlike wild-type CheZ, all the four mutant proteins failed to oligomerize upon interaction with CheY approximately P. On the basis of these and earlier results it is suggested that (i) oligomerization is required for the phosphatase activity of CheZ, (ii) the region defined by residues 141-145 plays an important role in mediating CheZ oligomerization and CheY approximately P dephosphorylation but is not necessary for the binding to CheY approximately P, (iii) the oligomerization and hence the phosphatase activity are regulated by the level of CheY approximately P, and (iv) this regulation plays a role in the adaptation to chemotactic stimuli.},

First, we implemented small molecule-controlled modulation of selection stringency that enables otherwise inaccessible activities to be evolved directly from inactive starting libraries through a period of evolutionary drift. Second, we developed a general negative selection that enables continuous counterselection against undesired activities. We integrated these developments to continuously evolve mutant T7 RNA polymerase enzymes with approximately 10,000-fold altered, rather than merely broadened, substrate specificities during a single three-day PACE experiment. The evolved enzymes exhibit specificity for their target substrate that exceeds that of wild-type RNA polymerases for their cognate substrates while maintaining wild type-like levels of activity.},

Furthermore, we use the model to compensate for significant spectral cross-reactivity inherent to the two sensors in order to develop a new method for programming two simultaneous and independent gene expression signals within the same cell.

@article{Towbin2017,
abstract = {Organisms adjust their gene expression to improve fitness in diverse environments. But finding the optimal expression in each environment presents a challenge. We ask how good cells are at finding such optima by studying the control of carbon catabolism genes in Escherichia coli. Bacteria show a growth law: growth rate on different carbon sources declines linearly with the steady-state expression of carbon catabolic genes. We experimentally modulate gene expression to ask if this growth law always maximizes growth rate, as has been suggested by theory. We find that the growth law is optimal in many conditions, including a range of perturbations to lactose uptake, but provides sub-optimal growth on several other carbon sources. Combining theory and experiment, we genetically re-engineer E. coli to make sub-optimal conditions into optimal ones and vice versa. We conclude that the carbon growth law is not always optimal, but represents a practical heuristic that often works but sometimes fails. T o maximize their fitness, organisms need to make appropriate choices to best use their limited resources. But organisms face diverse environments, and in each environment the optimal resource allocation is different. This raises the challenge of finding the optimal response in the large number of possible environments that organisms encounter. Studies of decision making in humans and animals reveal that they make heuristic calculations, known as rules of thumb, that often work but sometimes fail 1–3 . Cells also face different environments and need to allocate their resources appropriately 4,5 . We ask whether cells also use practical heuri-stics, or—as is often assumed in analysis of cell circuits 4,6,7 — evolve accurate regulatory mechanisms that allow them to be optimal under all conditions. To explore this question, we use resource allocation in the bacterium E. coli as a model system. E. coli partitions its resources according to simple linear rules as a function of growth rate, called growth laws 4,8,9 . The expression of most proteins for biomass synthesis, such as ribosomes, increases linearly with growth rate 8 . Conversely, the expression of most enzymes for nutrient uptake and catabolism decreases approximately linearly with growth rate 4 . At least two explanations are possible for these growth laws. First, the laws can represent the optimal solutions, as suggested by several elegant models describing cellular resource allocation 4–7,10–12 . One prediction from this picture is that the growth rate is optimal under all conditions that respect the growth laws and that sub-optimal resource allocation only occurs, when cells deviate from these laws. Previous studies identified conditions of sub-optimal growth in E. coli, but did not address this sub-optimality in the context of growth laws 13–15 or focused specifically on conditions that do not follow the growth law 16 , so that it remains unclear whether growth laws maximize the growth rate. A second possible explanation for growth laws is that they are practical heuristics: the growth law line is determined by cellular regulation and not by optimality constraints. In this scenario, regulation is expected to maximize the growth rate in many conditions, but to lead to sub-optimal growth in other conditions. Here we experimentally test the optimality of the carbon growth law—the linear relation between growth rate and resource allocation to carbon catabolism. We find that the carbon growth law provides optimal resource allocation under many conditions, including a wide range of perturbations to lactose uptake. However, on several other carbon sources the growth rate can be improved by experimentally forcing cells to break the growth law. We conclude that linear growth laws are not always optimal for rapid growth. We suggest that growth laws emerge from a transcriptional feedback mechanism that encodes optimal gene control under some conditions, but that is sub-optimal for rapid growth under other conditions. Results Open-loop control tests optimality of the carbon growth law. To test the optimality of a growth law, we chose the well-studied carbon catabolism system, controlled by the regulatory molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP activates the transcription factor CRP, which controls the expression of hundreds of proteins, including many carbon catabolic enzymes 17 and is also involved in coordinating nitrogen and carbon metabolism 4,18 . High internal carbon concentrations negatively affect cAMP concentra-tions forming a negative feedback circuit 4,19 (Fig. 1a). We determined growth rate and the activity of CRP (denoted CRP*) using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter at high temporal resolution (9 min) throughout exponential growth in a robotic multi-well plate reader 20 with day–day errors of 4{\%} for growth},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli many heterologous proteins are produced in the periplasm. To direct these proteins to the periplasm, they are equipped with an N-terminal signal sequence so that they can traverse the cytoplasmic membrane via the protein-conducting Sec-translocon. For poorly understood reasons, the production of heterologous secretory proteins is often toxic to the cell thereby limiting yields. To gain insight into the mechanism(s) that underlie this toxicity we produced two secretory heterologous proteins, super folder green fluorescent protein and a single-chain variable antibody fragment, in the Lemo21(DE3) strain. In this strain, the expression intensity of the gene encoding the target protein can be precisely controlled. Both SFGFP and the single-chain variable antibody fragment were equipped with a DsbA-derived signal sequence. Producing these proteins following different gene expression levels in Lemo21(DE3) allowed us to identify the optimal expression level for each target gene. Too high gene expression levels resulted in saturation of the Sec-translocon capacity as shown by hampered translocation of endogenous secretory proteins and a protein misfolding/aggregation problem in the cytoplasm. At the optimal gene expression levels, the negative effects of the production of the heterologous secretory proteins were minimized and yields in the periplasm were optimized. Saturating the Sec-translocon capacity can be a major bottleneck hampering heterologous protein production in the periplasm. This bottleneck can be alleviated by harmonizing expression levels of the genes encoding the heterologous secretory proteins with the Sec-translocon capacity. Mechanistic insight into the production of proteins in the periplasm is key to optimizing yields in this compartment.},

Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.},

abstract = {RNA folding plays an important role in controlling protein synthesis as well as other cellular processes. Existing models have focused on how RNA folding energetics control translation initiation rate under equilibrium conditions but have largely ignored the effects of nonequilibrium RNA folding. We introduce a new mechanism, called “ribosome drafting”, that explains how a mRNA's folding kinetics and the ribosome's binding rate collectively control its translation initiation rate. During cycles of translation, ribosome drafting emerges whenever successive ribosomes bind to a mRNA faster than the mRNA can refold, maintaining it in a nonequilibrium state with an acceleration of protein synthesis. Using computational design, time-correlated single photon counting, and expression measurements, we demonstrate that slow-folding and fast-folding RNA structures with equivalent folding energetics can vary protein synthesis rates by 1000-fold. We determine the necessary conditions for ribosome drafting by character...},

abstract = {Rational engineering of biological systems is often complicated by the complex but unwanted interactions between cellular components at multiple levels. Here we address this issue at the level of prokaryotic transcription by insulating minimal promoters and operators to prevent their interaction and enable the biophysical modeling of synthetic transcription without free parameters. This approach allows genetic circuit design with extraordinary precision and diversity, and consequently simplifies the design-build-Test-learn cycle of circuit engineering to a mix-And-match workflow. As a demonstration, combinatorial promoters encoding NOT-gate functions were designed from scratch with mean errors of {\textless}1.5-fold and a success rate of {\textgreater}96{\%} using our insulated transcription elements. Furthermore, four-node transcriptional networks with incoherent feed-forward loops that execute stripe-forming functions were obtained without any trial-And-error work. This insulation-based engineering strategy improves the resolution of genetic circuit technology and provides a simple approach for designing genetic circuits for systems and synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Production of fuels and chemicals through microbial fermentation of plant material is a desirable alternative to petrochemical-based production. Fermentative production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals requires the engineering of biocatalysts that can quickly and efficiently convert sugars to target products at a cost that is competitive with existing petrochemical-based processes. It is also important that biocatalysts be robust to extreme fermentation conditions, biomass-derived inhibitors, and their target products. Traditional metabolic engineering has made great advances in this area, but synthetic biology has contributed and will continue to contribute to this field, particularly with next-generation biofuels. This work reviews the use of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in biocatalyst engineering for biorenewable fuels and chemicals production, such as ethanol, butanol, acetate, lactate, succinate, alanine, and xylitol. We also examine the existing challenges in this area and discuss strategies for improving biocatalyst tolerance to chemical inhibitors.},

abstract = {Biological systems need to function accurately in the presence of strong noise and at the same time respond sensitively to subtle external cues. Here we study design principles in biochemical oscillatory circuits to achieve these two seemingly incompatible goals. We show that energy dissipation can enhance phase sensitivity linearly by driving the phase-amplitude coupling and increase timing accuracy by suppressing phase diffusion. Two general design principles in the key underlying reaction loop formed by two antiparallel pathways are found to optimize oscillation performance with a given energy budget: balancing the forward-to-backward flux ratio between the two pathways to reduce phase diffusion and maximizing the net flux of the phase-advancing pathway relative to that of the phase-retreating pathway to enhance phase sensitivity. Experimental evidences consistent with these design principles are found in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria. Future experiments to test the predicted dependence of phase sensitivity on energy dissipation are proposed.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, DNA replication is coupled to the cell cycle through the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases and associated factors. In bacteria, the prevailing view, based primarily from work in Escherichia coli, is that growth-dependent accumulation of the highly conserved initiator, DnaA, triggers initiation. However, the timing of initiation is unchanged in Bacillus subtilis mutants that are {\~{}}30{\%} smaller than wild-type cells, indicating that achievement of a particular cell size is not obligatory for initiation. Prompted by this finding, we re-examined the link between cell size and initiation in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Although changes in DNA replication have been shown to alter both E. coli and B. subtilis cell size, the converse (the effect of cell size on DNA replication) has not been explored. Here, we report that the mechanisms responsible for coordinating DNA replication with cell size vary between these two model organisms. In contrast to B. subtilis, small E. coli mutants delayed replication initiation until they achieved the size at which wild-type cells initiate. Modest increases in DnaA alleviated the delay, supporting the view that growth-dependent accumulation of DnaA is the trigger for replication initiation in E. coli. Significantly, although small E. coli and B. subtilis cells both maintained wild-type concentration of DnaA, only the E. coli mutants failed to initiate on time. Thus, rather than the concentration, the total amount of DnaA appears to be more important for initiation timing in E. coli. The difference in behavior of the two bacteria appears to lie in the mechanisms that control the activity of DnaA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the bottlenecks in production of biochemicals and pharmaceuticals in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is stable and homogeneous expression of pathway genes. Integration of genes into the genome of the production organism is often a preferred option when compared to expression from episomal vectors. Existing approaches for achieving stable simultaneous genome integrations of multiple DNA fragments often result in relatively low integration efficiencies and furthermore rely on the use of selection markers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we have developed a novel method, CrEdit (CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome Editing), which utilizes targeted double strand breaks caused by CRISPR/Cas9 to significantly increase the efficiency of homologous integration in order to edit and manipulate genomic DNA. Using CrEdit, the efficiency and locus specificity of targeted genome integrations reach close to 100{\%} for single gene integration using short homology arms down to 60 base pairs both with and without selection. This enables direct and cost efficient inclusion of homology arms in PCR primers. As a proof of concept, a non-native $\beta$-carotene pathway was reconstructed in S. cerevisiae by simultaneous integration of three pathway genes into individual intergenic genomic sites. Using longer homology arms, we demonstrate highly efficient and locus-specific genome integration even without selection with up to 84{\%} correct clones for simultaneous integration of three gene expression cassettes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The CrEdit approach enables fast and cost effective genome integration for engineering of S. cerevisiae. Since the choice of the targeting sites is flexible, CrEdit is a powerful tool for diverse genome engineering applications.},

The results illustrate the importance of a direct or indirect interaction between the P3b hairpin of aptamer 2 and the P1 helix of aptamer 1 in cooperative glycine binding. Furthermore, our data support a model in which glycine binding is sequential; where the binding of glycine to the second aptamer allows tertiary interactions to be made that facilitate binding of a second glycine molecule to the first aptamer.

The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

abstract = {Most known glycine riboswitches have two homologous aptamer domains arranged in tandem and separated by a short linker. The two aptamers associate through reciprocal "quaternary" interactions that have been proposed to result in cooperative glycine binding. Recently, the interaptamer linker was found to form helix P0 with a previously unrecognized segment 5' to the first aptamer domain. P0 was shown to increase glycine affinity, abolish cooperativity, and conform to the K-turn motif consensus. We examine the global thermodynamic and structural role of P0 using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), respectively. To evaluate the generality of P0 function, we prepared glycine riboswitch constructs lacking and including P0 from Bacillus subtilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Vibrio cholerae. We find that P0 indeed folds into a K-turn, supports partial pre-folding of all three glycine-free RNAs, and is required for ITC observation of glycine binding under physiologic Mg(2+) concentrations. Except for the unusually small riboswitch from F. nucleatum, the K-turn is needed for maximally compacting the glycine-bound states of the RNAs. Formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex between the B. subtilis or the F. nucleatum RNA constructs and the bacterial K-turn binding protein YbxF promotes additional folding of the free riboswitch, and enhances glycine binding. Consistent with the previously reported loss of cooperativity, P0-containing B. subtilis and V. cholerae tandem aptamers bound no more than one glycine molecule per riboswitch. Our results indicate that the P0 K-turn helps organize the quaternary structure of tandem glycine riboswitches, thereby facilitating ligand binding under physiologic conditions.},

Thus, there is a critical need to use antibiotics more effectively, extend the shelf life of existing antibiotics and minimize their side effects. This requires understanding the mechanisms underlying bacterial drug responses. Past studies have focused on survival in the presence of antibiotics by individual cells, as genetic mutants or persisters. Also important, however, is the fact that a population of bacterial cells can collectively survive antibiotic treatments lethal to individual cells. This tolerance can arise by diverse mechanisms, including resistance-conferring enzyme production, titration-mediated bistable growth inhibition, swarming and interpopulation interactions. These strategies can enable rapid population recovery after antibiotic treatment and provide a time window during which otherwise susceptible bacteria can acquire inheritable genetic resistance. Here, we emphasize the potential for targeting collective antibiotic tolerance behaviors as an antibacterial treatment strategy.},

abstract = {A quantitative description of the relationship between protein expression levels and open reading frame (ORF) nucleotide sequences is important for understanding natural systems, designing synthetic systems, and optimizing heterologous expression. Codon identity, mRNA secondary structure, and nucleotide composition within ORFs markedly influence expression levels. Bioinformatic analysis of ORF sequences in 816 bacterial genomes revealed that these features show distinct regional trends. To investigate their effects on protein expression, we designed 285 synthetic genes and determined corresponding expression levels in vitro using Escherichia coli extracts. We developed a mathematical function, parameterized using this synthetic gene data set, which enables computation of protein expression levels from ORF nucleotide sequences. In addition to its practical application in the design of heterologous expression systems, this equation provides mechanistic insight into the factors that control translation efficiency. We found that expression is strongly dependent on the presence of high AU content and low secondary structure in the ORF 5' region. Choice of high-frequency codons contributes to a lesser extent. The 3' terminal AU content makes modest, but detectable contributions. We present a model for the effect of these factors on the three phases of ribosomal function: initiation, elongation, and termination. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Light is a powerful tool for manipulating living cells because it can be applied with high resolution across space and over time. We previously constructed a red light-sensitive Escherichia coli transcription system based on a chimera between the red/far-red switchable cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 and the E. coli EnvZ/OmpR two-component signaling pathway. Here, we report the development of a green light-inducible transcription system in E. coli based on a recently discovered green/red photoswitchable two-component system from cyanobacteria. We demonstrate that the transcriptional output is proportional to the intensity of green light applied and that the green sensor is orthogonal to the red sensor at intensities of 532-nm light less than 0.01 W/m2. Expression of both sensors in a single cell allows two-color optical control of transcription both in batch culture and in patterns across a lawn of engineered cells. Because each sensor functions as a photoreversible switch, this system should allow the spatial and temporal control of the expression of multiple genes through different combinations of light wavelengths. This feature aids precision single-cell and population-level studies in systems and synthetic biology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gierer1972,
abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto- and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto- and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution. Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and monomolecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantitative data on hydra — a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation — and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation.},

However, mobile genes can confer profoundly different phenotypes on different strains of the same species. Little is known about the function and distribution of mobile genes in the human microbiome, and in particular whether the gene pool is globally homogenous or constrained by human population structure. Here, we investigate this question by comparing the mobile genes found in the microbiomes of 81 metropolitan North Americans with those of 172 agrarian Fiji islanders using a combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics. We find large differences in mobile gene content between the Fijian and North American microbiomes, with functional variation that mirrors known dietary differences such as the excess of plant-based starch degradation genes found in Fijian individuals. Notably, we also observed differences between the mobile gene pools of neighbouring Fijian villages, even though microbiome composition across villages is similar. Finally, we observe high rates of recombination leading to individual-specific mobile elements, suggesting that the abundance of some genes may reflect environmental selection rather than dispersal limitation. Together, these data support the hypothesis that human activities and behaviours provide selective pressures that shape mobile gene pools, and that acquisition of mobile genes is important for colonizing specific human populations.},

abstract = {Bacterial growth follows simple laws in constant conditions. However, bacteria in nature often face fluctuating environments. We therefore ask whether there are growth laws that apply to changing environments. We derive a law for upshifts using an optimal resource-allocation model: the post-shift growth rate equals the geometrical mean of the pre-shift growth rate and the growth rate on saturating carbon. We test this using chemostat and batch culture experiments, as well as previous data from several species. The increase in growth rate after an upshift indicates that ribosomes have spare capacity (SC). We demonstrate theoretically that SC has the cost of slow steady-state growth but is beneficial after an upshift because it prevents large overshoots in intracellular metabolites and allows rapid response to change. We also provide predictions for downshifts. The present study quantifies the optimal degree of SC, which rises the slower the growth rate, and suggests that SC can be precisely regulated. Bacterial growth depends on numerous reactions and yet in constant conditions follows surprisingly simple laws. Korem Kohanim et al. combine theory and experiment to find patterns in bacterial growth also for changing environments. These emerging patterns imply that bacteria save unused ribosomal capacity to better respond to change.},

abstract = {The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endo-nuclease that uses RNA-DNA complementarity to identify target sites for sequence-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage(1-5). In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site in dsDNA(4-7). Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms(8), but it has been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA(5). Here we show that Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA(ssRNA) targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage(7). Using specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA sequences, and we demonstrate that this strategy enables the isolation of a specific endogenous messenger RNA from cells. These results reveal a fundamental connection between PAM binding and substrate selection by Cas9, and highlight the utility of Cas9 for programmable transcript recognition without the need for tags.},

They acquire their functionality from synthetic gene circuits, the configuration of which defines the response signal and signal-to-noise ratio. Bioreporters based on the Escherichia coli ArsR system have raised significant interest for quantifying arsenic pollution, but they need to be carefully optimized to accurately work in the required low concentration range (1-10 $\mu$g arsenite L-1). To better understand the general functioning of ArsR-based genetic circuits, we developed a comprehensive mechanistic model that was empirically tested and validated in E. coli carrying different circuit configurations. The model accounts for the different elements in the circuits (proteins, DNA, chemical species), and their detailed affinities and interactions, and predicts the (fluorescent) output from the bioreporter cell as a function of arsenite concentration. The model was parametrized using existing ArsR biochemical data, and then complemented by parameter estimations from the accompanying experimental data using a scatter search algorithm. Model predictions and experimental data were largely coherent for feedback and uncoupled circuit configurations, different ArsR alleles, promoter strengths, and presence or absence of arsenic efflux in the bioreporters. Interestingly, the model predicted a particular useful circuit variant having steeper response at low arsenite concentrations, which was experimentally confirmed and may be useful as arsenic bioreporter in the field. From the extensive validation we expect the mechanistic model to further be a useful framework for detailed modeling of other synthetic circuits.},

abstract = {Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a large family of modular RNA-binding proteins which mediate several aspects of gene expression primarily in organelles but also in the nucleus. These proteins facilitate processing, splicing, editing, stability and translation of RNAs. While major advances in PPR research have been achieved with plant PPR proteins, the significance of non-plant PPR proteins is becoming of increasing importance. PPR proteins are classified into different subclasses based on their domain architecture, which is often a reflection of their function. This review provides an overview of the significant findings regarding the functions, evolution and applications of PPR proteins. Horizontal gene transfer appears to have played a major role in the sporadic phylogenetic distribution of different PPR subclasses in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Additionally, the use of synthetic biology and protein engineering to create designer PPR proteins to control gene expression in vivo is discussed. This review also highlights some of the aspects of PPR research that require more attention particularly in non-plant organisms. This includes the lack of research into the recently discovered PPR-TGM subclass, which is not only the first PPR subclass absent from plants but present in economically and clinically-relevant pathogens. Investigation into the structure and function of PPR-TGM proteins in these pathogens presents a novel opportunity for the exploitation of PPR proteins as drug targets to prevent disease.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative case study of transcriptional regulation in which we carry out a systematic dialogue between theory and measurement for an important and ubiquitous regulatory motif in bacteria, namely, that of simple repression. This architecture is realized by a single repressor binding site overlapping the promoter. From the theory point of view, this motif is described by a single gene regulation function based upon only a few parameters that are convenient theoretically and accessible experimentally. The usual approach is turned on its side by using the mathematical description of these regulatory motifs as a predictive tool to determine the number of repressors in a collection of strainswith a large variation in repressor copy number. The predictions and corresponding measurements are carried out over a large dynamic range in both expression fold change (spanning nearly four orders of magnitude) and repressor copy number (spanning about two orders ofmagnitude). The predictions are tested by measuring the resulting level of gene expression and are then validated by using quantitative immunoblots. The key outcomes of this study include a systematic quantitative analysis of the limits and validity of the input-output relation for simple repression, a precise determination of the in vivo binding energies for DNA-repressor interactions for several distinct repressor binding sites, and a repressor census for Lac repressor in Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {As in eukaryotes, bacterial genomes are not randomly folded. Bacterial genetic information is generally carried on a circular chromosome with a single origin of replication from which two replication forks proceed bidirectionally toward the opposite terminus region. Here, we investigate the higher-order architecture of the Escherichia coli genome, showing its partition into two structurally distinct entities by a complex and intertwined network of contacts: the replication terminus (ter) region and the rest of the chromosome. Outside of ter, the condensin MukBEF and the ubiquitous nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) HU promote DNA contacts in the megabase range. Within ter, the MatP protein prevents MukBEF activity, and contacts are restricted to ∼280 kb, creating a domain with distinct structural properties. We also show how other NAPs contribute to nucleoid organization, such as H-NS, which restricts short-range interactions. Combined, these results reveal the contributions of major evolutionarily conserved proteins in a bacterial chromosome organization. Contacts within the E. coli chromosome effectively divide it into functionally distinct structural regions.},

abstract = {Synthetic genetic systems share resources with the host, including machinery for transcription and translation. Phage RNA polymerases (RNAPs) decouple transcription from the host and generate high expression. However, they can exhibit toxicity and lack accessory proteins ($\sigma$ factors and activators) that enable switching between different promoters and modulation of activity. Here, we show that T7 RNAP (883 amino acids) can be divided into four fragments that have to be co-expressed to function. The DNA-binding loop is encoded in a C-terminal 285-aa '$\sigma$ fragment', and fragments with different specificity can direct the remaining 601-aa 'core fragment' to different promoters. Using these parts, we have built a resource allocator that sets the core fragment concentration, which is then shared by multiple $\sigma$ fragments. Adjusting the concentration of the core fragment sets the maximum transcriptional capacity available to a synthetic system. Further, positive and negative regulation is implemented using a 67-aa N-terminal '$\alpha$ fragment' and a null (inactivated) $\sigma$ fragment, respectively. The $\alpha$ fragment can be fused to recombinant proteins to make promoters responsive to their levels. These parts provide a toolbox to allocate transcriptional resources via different schemes, which we demonstrate by building a system which adjusts promoter activity to compensate for the difference in copy number of two plasmids.},

abstract = {Genetic circuits require many regulatory parts in order to implement signal processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use dCas9, which employs small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to repress genetic loci via the programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas9 and designed sgRNAs to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic Escherichia coli $\sigma$70 promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These sgRNAs exhibit high on-target repression (56- to 440-fold) and negligible off-target interactions ({\textless} 1.3-fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the Boolean-complete NOR gate and a 3-gate circuit consisting of four layered sgRNAs. The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by designing output sgRNAs to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance).},

Multiphoton microscopy has improved our understanding of kidney physiology and pathophysiology by enabling the visualization of the living kidney in comparison with the static view of previous technologies. The use of multiphoton microscopy with rodent models in conjunction with endogenous fluorescence and exogenous infused dyes permits the measurement of renal processes, such as glomerular permeability, juxtaglomerular apparatus function, tubulointerstitial function, tubulovascular interactions, vascular flow rate, and the intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Subcellular processes, including mitochondrial dynamics, reactive oxy- gen species production, cytosolic ion concentrations, and death processes apoptosis and necrosis, can also be measured by multiphoton microscopy. This has allowed valuable insight into the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, hypertensive nephropathy, as well as inflammatory responses of the kidney. The current review presents an overview of multiphoton microscopy with a focus on techniques for imaging the kidney and gives examples of instances where multiphoton microscopy has been utilized to study renal pathophysiology in the living kidney. With continued advancements in the field of biological optics and increased adoption in experimental nephrology, multiphoton microscopy will undoubtedly continue to create new paradigms in kidney disease},

In rare instances, two aptamers or sometimes two complete riboswitches reside adjacent to each other in untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. We have examined an example of a tandem riboswitch in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis that includes two complete riboswitches for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Unlike other complex riboswitch systems described recently, tandem TPP riboswitches do not exhibit cooperative ligand binding and do not detect two different types of metabolites. In contrast, both riboswitches respond independently to TPP and are predicted to function in concert to mimic the more "digital" gene control outcome observed when two aptamers bind ligands cooperatively. Our findings further demonstrate that simple gene control elements made only of RNA can be assembled in different architectures to yield more complex gene control outcomes.},

abstract = {Two-component regulatory systems drive signal transduction in bacteria. The simplest of these employs a membrane sensor kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. Environmental sensing is typically coupled to gene regulation. The histidine kinase EnvZ and its cognate response regulator OmpR regulate expression of outer membrane proteins (porins) in response to osmotic stress. We used hydrogen:deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to identify conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ (EnvZc) that were associated with osmosensing. The osmosensor localized to a seventeen amino acid region of the four-helix bundle of the cytoplasmic domain and flanked the His243 autophosphorylation site. High osmolality increased autophosphorylation of His243, suggesting that these two events were linked. The transmembrane domains were not required for osmosensing, but mutants in the transmembrane domains altered EnvZ activity. A photoactivatable fusion protein composed of EnvZc fused to the fluorophore mEos2 (EnvZc-mEos2) was as capable as EnvZc in supporting OmpR-dependent ompF and ompC transcription. Over-expression of EnvZc reduced activity, indicating that the EnvZ/OmpR system is not robust. Our results support a model in which osmolytes stabilize helix one in the four-helix bundle of EnvZ by increased hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone, increasing autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. The likelihood that additional histidine kinases use similar cytoplasmic sensing mechanisms is discussed.},

abstract = {Modern synthetic biology depends on the manufacture of large DNA constructs from libraries of genes, regulatory elements or other genetic parts. Type IIS-restriction enzyme-dependent DNA assembly methods (e.g., Golden Gate) enable rapid one-pot, ordered, multi-fragment DNA assembly, facilitating the generation of high-complexity constructs. The order of assembly of genetic parts is determined by the ligation of flanking Watson-Crick base-paired overhangs. The ligation of mismatched overhangs leads to erroneous assembly, and the need to avoid such pairings has typically been accomplished by using small sets of empirically vetted junction pairs, limiting the number of parts that can be joined in a single reaction. Here, we report the use of a comprehensive method for profiling end-joining ligation fidelity and bias to predict highly accurate sets of connections for ligation-based DNA assembly methods. This data set allows quantification of sequence-dependent ligation efficiency and identification of mismatch-prone pairings. The ligation profile accurately predicted junction fidelity in ten-fragment Golden Gate assembly reactions, and enabled efficient assembly of a lac cassette from up to 24-fragments in a single reaction. Application of the ligation fidelity profile to inform choice of junctions thus enables highly flexible assembly design, with {\textgreater}20 fragments in a single reaction.},

@article{Gaudelli2017,
abstract = {In 2016, David Liu and colleagues developed a DNA 'base editor'a system that would make it possible to change CG base pairs to TA base pairs within DNA without introducing double-stranded breaks. This approach involves tethering of a cytidine deaminase to an inactive RNA-guided Cas9 complex that enables site selectivity. However, this system was unable to correct about half of the single nucleotide polymorphisms that are known to be pathogenic. Now, David Liu and collaborators describe the next step in genomic base editing technology, designed to tackle the conversion of AT base pairs to GC base pairs. Beginning with a bacterial adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA, they used seven rounds of selection and refinement to produce ABE7.10. This enzyme, again tethered to an inactive RNA-guided Cas9 complex, uses DNA as a substrate and resulted in an average correction efficiency of 53{\%} across multiple sites and contexts in the genome, with a very low mutagenic background. Importantly, the system can be used both to correct disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms and to introduce disease-suppressing ones.},

abstract = {The study of the growth of bacterial cultures does not constitute a specialized subject or branch of research: it is the basic method of Microbiology. It would be a foolish enterprise, and doomed to failure, to attempt reviewing briefly a "subject" which covers actually our whole discipline. Unless, of course, we considered the formal laws of growth for their own sake, an approach which has repeatedly proved sterile. In the present review we shall consider bacterial growth as a method for the study of bacterial physiology and biochemistry. More precisely, we shall concern ourselves with the quantitative aspects of the method, with the interpretation of quantitative data referring to bacterial growth. Furthermore, we shall consider z exclusively the positive phases of growth, since the study of bacterial "death," i.e., of the negative phases of growth, involves distinct problems and methods. The discussion will be limited to populations considered genetically homogeneous. The problems of mutation and selection in growing cultures have been excellently dealt with in recent review articles by Delbriick (1) and Luria (2). No attempt is made at reviewing the literature on a subject which, as we have just seen, is not really a subject at all. The papers and results quoted have been selected as illustrations of the points discussed.},

abstract = {An inability to reliably predict quantitative behaviors for novel combinations of genetic elements limits the rational engineering of biological systems. We developed an expression cassette architecture for genetic elements controlling transcription and translation initiation in Escherichia coli: transcription elements encode a common mRNA start, and translation elements use an overlapping genetic motif found in many natural systems. We engineered libraries of constitutive and repressor-regulated promoters along with translation initiation elements following these definitions. We measured activity distributions for each library and selected elements that collectively resulted in expression across a 1,000-fold observed dynamic range. We studied all combinations of curated elements, demonstrating that arbitrary genes are reliably expressed to within twofold relative target expression windows with ∼93{\%} reliability. We expect the genetic element definitions validated here can be collectively expanded to create collections of public-domain standard biological parts that support reliable forward engineering of gene expression at genome scales.},

abstract = {We present a programmable droplet-based microfluidic device that combines the reconfigurable flow-routing capabilities of integrated microvalve technology with the sample compartmentalization and dispersion-free transport that is inherent to droplets. The device allows for the execution of user-defined multistep reaction protocols in 95 individually addressable nanoliter-volume storage chambers by consecutively merging programmable sequences of picoliter-volume droplets containing reagents or cells. This functionality is enabled by "flow-controlled wetting," a droplet docking and merging mechanism that exploits the physics of droplet flow through a channel to control the precise location of droplet wetting. The device also allows for automated cross-contaminationfree recovery of reaction products from individual chambers into standard microfuge tubes for downstream analysis. The combined features of programmability, addressability, and selective recovery provide a general hardware platform that can be reprogrammed for multiple applications. We demonstrate this versatility by implementing multiple single-cell experiment types with this device: bacterial cell sorting and cultivation, taxonomic gene identification, and high-throughput single-cell whole genome amplification and sequencing using common laboratory strains. Finally, we apply the device to genome analysis of single cells and microbial consortia from diverse environmental samples including a marine enrichment culture, deep-sea sediments, and the human oral cavity. The resulting datasets capture genotypic properties of individual cells and illuminate known and potentially unique partnerships between microbial community members.},

Using millisecond single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in living cells expressing fluorescent derivatives of replisome components, we have examined replisome stoichiometry and architecture. Active Escherichia coli replisomes contain three molecules of the replicative polymerase, rather than the historically accepted two. These are associated with three molecules of x, a clamp loader component that trimerizes polymerase. Only two of the three sliding clamps are always associated with the core replisome. Single-strand binding protein has a broader spatial distribution than the core components, with 5 to 11 tetramers per replisome.

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two Bacillus subtilis biofilm communities undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.},

Here we investigate the control of multistable gene regulatory networks, which are ubiquitously found in nature and play critical roles in cell differentiation and decision-making. Using an in silico feedback control loop, we demonstrate that a bistable genetic toggle switch can be dynamically maintained near its unstable equilibrium position for extended periods of time. Importantly, we show that a direct method based on dual periodic forcing is sufficient to simultaneously maintain many cells in this undecided state.

abstract = {The chemotaxis pathway of Escherichia coli is the most studied sensory system in prokaryotes. The highly conserved general architecture of this pathway consists of two modules which mediate signal transduction and adaptation. The signal transduction module detects and amplifies changes in environmental conditions and rapidly transmits these signals to control bacterial swimming behavior. The adaptation module gradually resets the activity and sensitivity of the first module after initial stimulation and thereby enables the temporal comparisons necessary for bacterial chemotaxis. Recent experimental and theoretical work has unraveled multiple quantitative features emerging from the interplay between these two modules. This has laid the groundwork for rationalization of these emerging properties in the context of the evolutionary optimization of the chemotactic behavior.},

abstract = {Intracellular bacterial pathogens can exhibit large heterogeneity in growth rate inside host cells, with major consequences for the infection outcome. If and how the host responds to this heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Here, we combined a fluorescent reporter of bacterial cell division with single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to study the macrophage response to different intracellular states of the model pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The transcriptomes of individual infected macrophages revealed a spectrum of functional host response states to growing and non-growing bacteria. Intriguingly, macrophages harbouring non-growing Salmonella display hallmarks of the proinflammatory M1 polarization state and differ little from bystander cells, suggesting that non-growing bacteria evade recognition by intracellular immune receptors. By contrast, macrophages containing growing bacteria have turned into an anti-inflammatory, M2-like state, as if fast-growing intracellular Salmonella overcome host defence by reprogramming macrophage polarization. Additionally, our clustering approach reveals intermediate host functional states between these extremes. Altogether, our data suggest that gene expression variability in infected host cells shapes different cellular environments, some of which may favour a growth arrest of Salmonella facilitating immune evasion and the establishment of a long-term niche, while others allow Salmonella to escape intracellular antimicrobial activity and proliferate.},

abstract = {Understanding how bacteria coordinate gene expression with biomass growth to adapt to various stress conditions remains a grand challenge in biology. Stress response is often associated with dramatic accumulation of cellular guanosine tetra- or penta-phosphate (p)ppGpp (also known as 'magic spot'), which is a key second messenger participating in regulating various biochemical and physiological processes of bacteria. Despite of the extensive studies on the mechanism of gene regulation by (p)ppGpp during stringent response, the connection between (p)ppGpp and bacterial steady-state exponential growth remains elusive. Here, we establish a versatile genetic approach to systematically perturb the (p)ppGpp level of Escherichia coli through titrating either the single-function (p)ppGpp synthetase or the singe-function (p)ppGpp hydrolase and quantitatively characterize cell growth and gene expression. Strikingly, increased and decreased (p)ppGpp levels both cause remarkable growth suppression of E. coli. From a coarse-grained insight, we demonstrate that increased (p)ppGpp levels limit ribosome synthesis while decreased (p)ppGpp levels limit the expression of metabolic proteins, both resulting in non-optimal resource allocation. Our study reveals a profound role of (p)ppGpp in regulating bacterial growth through governing global resource allocation. Moreover, we highlight the Mesh1 (p)ppGpp hydrolase from Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful genetic tool for interrogating bacterial (p)ppGpp physiology.},

abstract = {Membrane transporters carry key metabolites through the cell membrane and, from a resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop through membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic "on-off" switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate.},

abstract = {The postantibiotic effect (PAE) refers to the temporary suppression of bacterial growth following transient antibiotic treatment. This effect has been observed for decades for a wide variety of antibiotics and microbial species. However, despite empirical observations , a mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is lacking. Using a combination of modeling and quantitative experiments, we show that the PAE can be explained by the temporal dynamics of drug detoxification in individual cells after an antibiotic is removed from the extracellular environment. These dynamics are dictated by both the export of the antibiotic and the intracellular titration of the antibiotic by its target. This mechanism is generally applicable for antibiotics with different modes of action. We further show that efflux inhibition is effective against certain antibiotic motifs, which may help explain mixed cotreatment success.},

abstract = {TaqMan and SYBR Green quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were developed as DNA-based approaches to reproducibly enumerate M13 and T7 phages from phage display selection experiments individually and simultaneously. The genome copies of M13 and T7 phages were quantified by TaqMan or SYBR Green qPCR referenced against M13 and T7 DNA standard curves of known concentrations. TaqMan qPCR was capable of quantifying M13 and T7 phage DNA simultaneously with a detection range of 2.75*101–2.75*108genome copies(gc)/$\mu$L and 2.66*101–2.66*108genome copies(gc)/$\mu$L respectively. TaqMan qPCR demonstrated an efficient amplification efficiency (Es) of 0.97 and 0.90 for M13 and T7 phage DNA, respectively. SYBR Green qPCR was ten-fold more sensitive than TaqMan qPCR, able to quantify 2.75–2.75*107gc/$\mu$L and 2.66*101–2.66*107gc/$\mu$L of M13 and T7 phage DNA, with an amplification efficiency Esof 1.06 and 0.78, respectively. Due to its superior sensitivity, SYBR Green qPCR was used to enumerate M13 and T7 phage display clones selected against a cell line, and quantified titers demonstrated accuracy comparable to titers from traditional double-layer plaque assay. Compared to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, both qPCR methods exhibited increased detection sensitivity and reproducibility. These qPCR methods are reproducible, sensitive, and time-saving to determine their titers and to quantify a large number of phage samples individually or simultaneously, thus avoiding the need for time-intensive double-layer plaque assay. These findings highlight the attractiveness of qPCR for phage enumeration for applications ranging from selection to next-generation sequencing (NGS).},

abstract = {Total transcript amplification (TTA) from single eukaryotic cells for transcriptome analysis is established, but TTA from a single prokaryotic cell presents additional challenges with much less starting material, the lack of poly(A)-tails, and the fact that the messages can be polycistronic. Here, we describe a novel method for single-bacterium TTA using a model organism, Burkholderia thailandensis, exposed to a subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent, glyphosate. Utilizing a B. thailandensis microarray to assess the TTA method showed low fold-change bias (less than twofold difference and Pearson correlation coefficient R ≈ 0.87-0.89) and drop-outs (4{\%}-6{\%} of 2842 detectable genes), compared with data obtained from the larger-scale nonamplified RNA samples. Further analysis of the microarray data suggests that B. thailandensis, when exposed to the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis inhibitor glyphosate, induces (or represses) genes to possibly recuperate and balance the intracellular amino acid pool. We validated our single-cell microarray data at the multi-cell and single-cell levels with lacZ and gfp reporter-gene fusions, respectively. Sanger sequencing of 192 clones generated from the TTA product of a single cell, with and without enrichment by elimination of rRNA and tRNA, detected only B. thailandensis sequences with no contamination. These data indicate that RNA-seq of TTA from a single cell is possible using this novel method. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of complex enzymatic reactions in highly crowded small volumes is crucial for the development of synthetic minimal cells. Compartmentalized biochemical reactions in cell-sized containers exhibit a degree of randomness due to the small number of molecules involved. However, it is unknown how the physical environment contributes to the stochastic nature of multistep enzymatic processes. Here, we present a robust method to quantify gene expression noise in vitro using droplet microfluidics. We study the changes in stochasticity in the cell-free gene expression of two genes compartmentalized within droplets as a function of DNA copy number and macromolecular crowding. We find that decreased diffusion caused by a crowded environment leads to the spontaneous formation of heterogeneous microenvironments of mRNA as local production rates exceed the diffusion rates of macromolecules. This heterogeneity leads to a higher probability of the molecular machinery staying in the same microenvironment, directly increasing the system's stochasticity.},

abstract = {Background: Engineers frequently vary design parameters to optimize the behaviour of a system. However, synthetic biologists lack the tools to rapidly explore a critical design parameter, gene expression level, and have no means of systematically varying the dosage of an entire genetic circuit. As a step toward overcoming this shortfall, we have developed a technology that enables the same plasmid to be maintained at different copy numbers in a set of closely related cells. This provides a rapid method for exploring gene or cassette dosage effects.Results: We engineered two sets of strains to constitutively provide a trans-acting replication factor, either Pi of the R6K plasmid or RepA of the ColE2 plasmid, at different doses. Each DIAL (different allele) strain supports the replication of a corresponding plasmid at a constant level between 1 and 250 copies per cell. The plasmids exhibit cell-to-cell variability comparable to other popular replicons, but with improved stability. Since the origins are orthogonal, both replication factors can be incorporated into the same cell. We demonstrate the utility of these strains by rapidly assessing the optimal expression level of a model biosynthetic pathway for violecein.Conclusions: The DIAL strains can rapidly optimize single gene expression levels, help balance expression of functionally coupled genetic elements, improve investigation of gene and circuit dosage effects, and enable faster development of metabolic pathways. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kittleson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {A set of 12 fluorogenic glycine riboswitches with dif- ferent thermodynamic and kinetic response proper- ties was engineered. For the design of functional ri- boswitches, a three-part RNA approach was applied based on the idea of linking a RNA sensor, trans- mitter and actuator part together. For the RNA sen- sor and actuator part, we used the tandem glycine aptamer structure from genic aptamer Spinach, respectively. To achieve op- timal signal transduction from the sensor to the ac- Bacillus s ubtillis, a nd fluoro- tuator, a riboswitch library with variable transmitter was screened with amicrofluidic large-scale integra- tion chip. This allowed us to establish the complete thermodynamic binding profiles of the riboswitch li- brary. Glycine dissociation constants of the 12 strong fluorescence response riboswitches varied between 99.7 and 570 ?M. Furthermore, the kinetic glycine binding ( k on), and dissociation ( k off) rates, and corre- sponding energy barriers of the 10 strongest fluores- cence response riboswitches were determined with the same chip platform. k on and off were in the order k of 10−3s−1 and 10−2s−1, respectively. Conclusively, we demonstrate that systematic screening of syn- thetic and natural linked RNA parts with microfluidic chip technology is an effective approach to rapidly generate fluorogenic metabolite riboswitches with a broad range of biophysical response properties.},

abstract = {By directly monitoring single cell growth in a microfluidic platform, we interrogated genome-deletion effects in Escherichia coli strains. We compared the growth dynamics of a wild type strain with a clean genome strain, and their derived mutants at the single-cell level. A decreased average growth rate and extended average lag time were found for the clean genome strain, compared to those of the wild type strain. Direct correlation between the growth rate and lag time of individual cells showed that the clean genome population was more heterogeneous. Cell culturability (the ratio of growing cells to the sum of growing and nongrowing cells) of the clean genome population was also lower. Interestingly, after the random mutations induced by a glucose starvation treatment, for the clean genome population mutants that had survived the competition of chemostat culture, each parameter markedly improved (i.e., the average growth rate and cell culturability increased, and the lag time and heterogeneity decreased). However, this effect was not seen in the wild type strain; the wild type mutants cultured in a chemostat retained a high diversity of growth phenotypes. These results suggest that quasi-essential genes that were deleted in the clean genome might be required to retain a diversity of growth characteristics at the individual cell level under environmental stress. These observations highlight that single-cell microfluidics can reveal subtle individual cellular responses, enabling in-depth understanding of the population.},

abstract = {Organisms must process information encoded via developmental and environmental signals to survive and reproduce. Researchers have also engineered synthetic genetic logic to realize simpler, independent control of biological processes. We developed a three-terminal device architecture, termed the transcriptor, that uses bacteriophage serine integrases to control the flow of RNA polymerase along DNA. Integrase-mediated inversion or deletion of DNA encoding transcription terminators or a promoter modulates transcription rates. We realized permanent amplifying AND, NAND, OR, XOR, NOR, and XNOR gates actuated across common control signal ranges and sequential logic supporting autonomous cell-cell communication of DNA encoding distinct logic-gate states. The single-layer digital logic architecture developed here enables engineering of amplifying logic gates to control transcription rates within and across diverse organisms.},

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Bacteria tightly regulate and coordinate the various events in their cell cycles to duplicate themselves accurately and to control their cell sizes. Growth of Escherichia coli , in particular, follows a relation known as Schaechter's growth law. This law says that the average cell volume scales exponentially with growth rate, with a scaling exponent equal to the time from initiation of a round of DNA replication to the cell division at which the corresponding sister chromosomes segregate. Here, we sought to test the robustness of the growth law to systematic perturbations in cell dimensions achieved by varying the expression levels of mreB and ftsZ . We found that decreasing the mreB level resulted in increased cell width, with little change in cell length, whereas decreasing the ftsZ level resulted in increased cell length. Furthermore, the time from replication termination to cell division increased with the perturbed dimension in both cases. Moreover, the growth law remained valid over a range of growth conditions and dimension perturbations. The growth law can be quantitatively interpreted as a consequence of a tight coupling of cell division to replication initiation. Thus, its robustness to perturbations in cell dimensions strongly supports models in which the timing of replication initiation governs that of cell division, and cell volume is the key phenomenological variable governing the timing of replication initiation. These conclusions are discussed in the context of our recently proposed “adder-per-origin” model, in which cells add a constant volume per origin between initiations and divide a constant time after initiation.},

We also demonstrate that it is possible to count the number of non-specifically DNA binding LacI-Venus molecules using short excitation light pulses. The transcription factors are localized on the nucleoids in the cell and appear to be uniformly distributed on chromosomal DNA. An increase in the expression of LacI is observed at the beginning of the cell cycle, possibly because some gene copies are de-repressed as a result of partitioning inequalities at cell division. Finally, a size-growth rate uncertainty relation is observed where cells living in rich media vary more in the length at birth than in generation time, and the opposite is true for cells living in poorer media.},

abstract = {Drug-resistant bacteria represent a significant global threat. Given the dearth of new antibiotics, host-directed therapies (HDTs) are especially desirable. As IFN-gamma (IFNgamma) plays a central role in host resistance to intracellular bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we searched for small molecules to augment the IFNgamma response in macrophages. Using an interferon-inducible nuclear protein Ipr1 as a biomarker of macrophage activation, we performed a high-throughput screen and identified molecules that synergized with low concentration of IFNgamma. Several active compounds belonged to the flavagline (rocaglate) family. In primary macrophages a subset of rocaglates 1) synergized with low concentrations of IFNgamma in stimulating expression of a subset of IFN-inducible genes, including a key regulator of the IFNgamma network, Irf1; 2) suppressed the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and type I IFN and 3) induced autophagy. These compounds may represent a basis for macrophage-directed therapies that fine-tune macrophage effector functions to combat intracellular pathogens and reduce inflammatory tissue damage. These therapies would be especially relevant to fighting drug-resistant pathogens, where improving host immunity may prove to be the ultimate resource.},

abstract = {Synthetic circuits embedded in host cells compete with cellular processes for limited intracellular resources. Here we show how funnelling of cellular resources, after global transcriptome degradation by the sequence-dependent endoribonuclease MazF, to a synthetic circuit can increase production. Target genes are protected from MazF activity by recoding the gene sequence to eliminate recognition sites, while preserving the amino acid sequence. The expression of a protected fluorescent reporter and flux of a high-value metabolite are significantly enhanced using this genome-scale control strategy. Proteomics measurements discover a host factor in need of protection to improve resource redistribution activity. A computational model demonstrates that the MazF mRNA-decay feedback loop enables proportional control of MazF in an optimal operating regime. Transcriptional profiling of MazF-induced cells elucidates the dynamic shifts in transcript abundance and discovers regulatory design elements. Altogether, our results suggest that manipulation of cellular resource allocation is a key control parameter for synthetic circuit design.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

abstract = {Optical microscopy of single bacteria growing on solid agarose support is a powerful method for studying the natural heterogeneity in growth and gene expression. While the material properties of agarose make it an excellent substrate for such studies, the sheer number of exponentially growing cells eventually overwhelms the agarose pad, which fundamentally limits the duration and the throughput of measurements. Here we overcome the limitations of exponential growth by patterning agarose pads on the sub-micron-scale. Linear tracks constrain the growth of bacteria into a high density array of linear micro-colonies. Buffer flow through microfluidic lines washes away excess cells and delivers fresh nutrient buffer. Densely patterned tracks allow us to cultivate and image hundreds of thousands of cells on a single agarose pad over 30-40 generations, which drastically increases single-cell measurement throughput. In addition, we show that patterned agarose can facilitate single-cell measurements within bacterial communities. As a proof-of-principle, we study a community of E. coli auxotrophs that can complement the amino acid deficiencies of one another. We find that the growth rate of colonies of one strain decreases sharply with the distance to colonies of the complementary strain over distances of only a few cell lengths. Because patterned agarose pads maintain cells in a chemostatic environment in which every cell can be imaged, we term our device the single-cell chemostat. High-throughput measurements of single cells growing chemostatically should greatly facilitate the study of a variety of microbial behaviours.},

abstract = {Genetic circuits in living cells share transcriptional and translational resources that are available in limited amounts. This leads to unexpected couplings among seemingly unconnected modules, which result in poorly predictable circuit behavior. In this study, we determine these interdependencies between products of different genes by characterizing the economy of how transcriptional and translational resources are allocated to the production of proteins in genetic circuits. We discover that, when expressed from the same plasmid, the combinations of attainable protein concentrations are constrained by a linear relationship, which can be interpreted as an isocost line, a concept used in microeconomics. We created a library of circuits with two reporter genes, one constitutive and the other inducible in the same plasmid, without a regulatory path between them. In agreement with the model predictions, experiments reveal that the isocost line rotates when changing the ribosome binding site strength of the inducible gene and shifts when modifying the plasmid copy number. These results demonstrate that isocost lines can be employed to predict how genetic circuits become coupled when sharing resources and provide design guidelines for minimizing the effects of such couplings.},

abstract = {One promise of synthetic biology is the creation of genetic circuitry that enables the execution of logical programming in living cells. Such 'wet programming' is positioned to transform a wide and diverse swathe of biotechnology ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to water treatment strategies. Although progress in the development of a library of genetic modules continues apace, a major challenge for their integration into larger circuits is the generation of sufficiently fast and precise communication between modules. An attractive approach is to integrate engineered circuits with host processes that facilitate robust cellular signalling. In this context, recent studies have demonstrated that bacterial protein degradation can trigger a precise response to stress by overloading a limited supply of intracellular proteases. Here we use protease competition to engineer rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We characterize coupling delay times that are more than an order of magnitude faster than standard transcription-factor-based coupling methods (less than 1 min compared with ∼20-40 min) and demonstrate tunability through manipulation of the linker between the protein and its degradation tag. We use this mechanism as a platform to couple genetic clocks at the intracellular and colony level, then synchronize the multi-colony dynamics to reduce variability in both clocks. We show how the coupled clock network can be used to encode independent environmental inputs into a single time series output, thus enabling frequency multiplexing (information transmitted on a common channel by distinct frequencies) in a genetic circuit context. Our results establish a general framework for the rapid and tunable coupling of genetic circuits through the use of native 'queueing' processes such as competitive protein degradation.},

For genetic algorithm, a chromosome represents an assignment of machines to cells, and fitness function defined as number of inter-cell transfer is used to select the part route alternative with minimal inter-cell movements. The space search algorithm is based on classification and ordering of machines and application of space search to recursively assign the most critical machines and parts to cells. Both algorithms have been studied with several decision making criteria: intercellular traffic, size of the machine cells, ratio of state space expansion, and so on. The results presented in the paper include inter-cell transfers and the cell size. Both algorithms have been applied to the same set of cell formation problems with alternate routings from literature and representative results are shown. Performance of both algorithms is evaluated with respect to the quality of the obtained solution (as compared with different algorithms on the same problem from literature).

abstract = {Artemisinin is a potent antimalarial drug; however, it suffers from unstable and insufficient supply from plant source. Here, we established a novel multivariate-modular approach based on experimental design for systematic pathway optimization that succeeded in improving the production of amorphadiene (AD), the precursor of artemisinin, in Escherichia coli. It was initially found that the AD production was limited by the imbalance of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate (PYR), the two precursors of the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway. Furthermore, it was identified that GAP and PYR could be balanced by replacing the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) with the ATP-dependent galactose permease and glucose kinase system (GGS) and this resulted in fivefold increase in AD titer (11 to 60 mg/L). Subsequently, the experimental design-aided systematic pathway optimization (EDASPO) method was applied to systematically optimize the transcriptional expressions of eight critical genes in the glucose uptake and the DXP and AD synthesis pathways. These genes were classified into four modules and simultaneously controlled by T7 promoter or its variants. A regression model was generated using the four-module experimental data and predicted the optimal expression ratios among these modules, resulting in another threefold increase in AD titer (60 to 201 mg/L). This EDASPO method may be useful for the optimization of other pathways and products beyond the scope of this study.},

abstract = {Microorganisms can produce hydrocarbons that can serve as replacements or additions to conventional liquid fuels for use in the transportation sector. However, a common problem in the microbial synthesis of biofuels is that these compounds often have toxic effects on the cell. In this study, we focused on mitigating the toxicity of the biojet fuel precursor pinene on Escherichia coli. We used genomic DNA from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, which has innate solvent-tolerance properties, to create transgenic libraries in an E. coli host. We exposed cells containing the library to pinene, selecting for genes that improved tolerance. Importantly, we found that expressing the sigma factor RpoD from P. putida greatly expanded the diversity of tolerance genes recovered. With low expression of rpoD P.putida , we isolated a single pinene tolerance gene; with increased expression of the sigma factor our selection experiments returned multiple distinct tolerance mechanisms, including some that have been previously documented and also new mechanisms. Interestingly, high levels of rpoD P.putida induction resulted in decreased diversity. We found that the tolerance levels provided by some genes are highly sensitive to the level of induction of rpoD P.putida , while others provide tolerance across a wide range of rpoD P.putida levels. This method for unlocking diversity in tolerance screening using heterologous sigma factor expression was applicable to both plasmid and fosmid-based transgenic libraries. These results suggest that by controlling the expression of appropriate heterologous sigma factors, we can greatly increase the searchable genomic space within transgenic libraries. M icroorganisms are capable of producing hydrocarbons that are precursors to liquid fuels. 1−3 For instance, Escherichia coli has been engineered using production pathways from other organisms to produce a wide variety of hydro-carbons such as alcohols, fatty acids, and monterpenes. 4−6 These chemicals can then be processed for use as biofuels. In this study we focused on the monoterpene pinene, which can serve as a precursor to biojet fuel. 7 A major challenge encountered in synthetic biology applications for engineering biofuel-producing strains is that often the chemicals produced are toxic to cells. Hydrocarbons can disrupt key physiological processes and interfere with membrane permeability and function. 8,9 This inhibits cell growth and leads to reduced biofuel production. Finding ways to combat biofuel toxicity may increase yields of microbial biofuels. 10},

abstract = {In situ hybridization of whole cells with rRNA-targeted, fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes is a powerful method to specifically detect microorganisms in their natural habitat without cultivation and subsequent identification by phenotypic characterization. To examine the use of this method for the specific detection of pathogenic Candida species, we have designed an oligonucleotide probe which binds to the 18S rRNA of C. albicans and C. tropicalis, the two most important pathogenic Candida species, and differentiates them from other clinically relevant species. After establishing suitable hybridization conditions, we confirmed the specificity of our probe O20 in RNA dot blot hybridizations with a series of reference strains and clinical isolates of medically important Candida species. All C. albicans and C. tropicalis strains hybridized with the probe, whereas all strains of C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr and C. lusitaniae did not. When we used the fluorescently labelled probe O20 to specifically detect single cells of the two target species by in situ hybridization, both C. albicans and C. tropicalis reacted strongly with the probe and could be clearly differentiated from C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, although the latter organism contains only two nucleotide mismatches in the probe target region. This discrimination capacity was also seen when mixed suspensions of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were hybridized with the probe. After infection of a human endothelial cell line with C. albicans and C. krusei, C. albicans cells adhering to the endothelial cells were easily distinguishable from the C. krusei cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization with probe O20. In addition, germ tubes and hyphae of C. albicans were also efficiently labelled. The application of fluorescently labelled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes therefore appears to be a valuable tool for the specific detection and identification of different members of the genus Candida, which does not require any cultivation.},

abstract = {In Gram-positive pathogens, surface proteins may be covalently anchored to the bacterial peptidoglycan by sortase, a cysteine transpeptidase enzyme. In contrast to other Gram-positive bacteria, only one single sortase enzyme, SrtB, is conserved between strains of Clostridium difficile. Sortase-mediated peptidase activity has been reported in vitro and seven potential substrates have been identified. Here we demonstrate the functionality of sortase in C. difficile. We identify two sortase-anchored proteins, the putative adhesins CD2831 and CD3246, and determine the cell wall anchor structure of CD2831. The C-terminal PPKTG sorting motif of CD2831 is cleaved between the threonine and glycine residues and the carboxyl group of threonine is amide-linked to the side chain amino group of diaminopimelic acid within the peptidoglycan peptide stem. We show that CD2831 protein levels are elevated in presence of high intracellular cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) concentrations, in agreement with the control of CD2831 expression by a c-di-GMP-dependent type II riboswitch. Low c-di-GMP levels induce the release of CD2831, and presumably CD3246, from the surface of cells. This regulation is mediated by proteolytic cleavage of CD2831 and CD3246 by the zinc metalloprotease ZmpI, whose expression is controlled by a type II c-di-GMP riboswitch. These data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for expression of two sortase substrates by the secondary messenger c-di-GMP, on which surface anchoring is dependent.},

abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

abstract = {Although the CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA system efficiently cleaves intracellular DNA at desired target sites, major concerns remain on potential "off-target" cleavage that may occur throughout the whole genome. In order to improve CRISPR-Cas9 specificity for targeted genome editing and transcriptional control, we describe a bioinformatics tool "sgRNAcas9", which is a software package developed for fast design of CRISPR sgRNA with minimized off-target effects. This package consists of programs to perform a search for CRISPR target sites (protospacers) with user-defined parameters, predict genome-wide Cas9 potential off-target cleavage sites (POT), classify the POT into three categories, batch-design oligonucleotides for constructing 20-nt (nucleotides) or truncated sgRNA expression vectors, extract desired length nucleotide sequences flanking the on- or off-target cleavage sites for designing PCR primer pairs to validate the mutations by T7E1 cleavage assay. Importantly, by identifying potential off-target sites in silico, the sgRNAcas9 allows the selection of more specific target sites and aids the identification of bona fide off-target sites, significantly facilitating the design of sgRNA for genome editing applications. sgRNAcas9 software package is publicly available at BiooTools website (www.biootools.com) under the terms of the GNU General Public License.},

abstract = {Studies on chemotaxis in microfluidics device have become a major area of research to generate physiologically similar environment in vitro. In this work, a novel micro-fluidic device has been developed to study chemo-taxis of cells in near physiological condition which can create controllable, steady and long-range chemical gradients using various chemo-effectors in a micro-channel. Hydrogels like agarose, collagen, etc, can be used in the device to maintain exclusive diffusive flux of various chemical species into the micro-channel under study. Variations of concentrations and flow rates of Texas Red dextran in the device revealed that an increase in the concentration of the dye in the feed from 6 to 18 $\mu$g ml-1, causes a steeper chemical gradient in the device, whereas the flow rate of the dye has practically no effect on the chemical gradient in the device. This observation confirms that a diffusion controlled chemical gradient is generated in the micro-channel. Chemo-taxis of E. coli cells were studied under the steady gradient of a chemo-attractant and a chemo-repellent separately in the same chemical gradient generator. For sorbitol and NiSO4{\textperiodcentered}6H2O, the bacterial cells exhibit a steady distribution in the micro channel after 1 h and 30 min, respectively. From the distribution of bacterial population chemo-tactic strength of the chemo-effectors was estimated for E. coli. In a long microfluidic channel, migration behavior of bacterial cells under diffusion controlled chemical gradient showed chemotaxis, random movement, aggregation, and concentration dependent reverse chemotaxis. {\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Our understanding of the system design principles controlling these responses is still at a rudimentary stage, and here we consider several recent experimental and theoretical studies that focus on these system design principles. Overt positive feedback loops, or double-negative feedback loops, can produce bistable or multistable systems under the appropriate conditions and can produce graded responses under other conditions. Several design features favor bistability in negatively controlled genetic systems, including a high kinetic order for repression and a large difference in the rates of gene expression in the "on" and "off" states. In positive feedback, a high kinetic order for the activation of gene expression favors bistability. Multistability can result from the combined effects of positive and negative regulators, or from the combined effects of regulators that each demonstrate bistability. Finally, bistability can result in enzymatic systems in which multiple reversible covalent modifications occur, even when no overt feedback loops are present.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology approaches commonly introduce heterologous gene networks into a host to predictably program cells, with the expectation of the synthetic network being orthogonal to the host background. However, introduced circuits may interfere with the host's physiology, either indirectly by posing a metabolic burden and/or through unintended direct interactions between parts of the circuit with those of the host, affecting functionality. Here we used RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis to quantify the interactions between a representative heterologous AND gate circuit and the host Escherichia coli under various conditions including circuit designs and plasmid copy numbers. We show that the circuit plasmid copy number outweighs circuit composition for their effect on host gene expression with medium-copy number plasmid showing more prominent interference than its low-copy number counterpart. In contrast, the circuits have a stronger influence on the host growth with a metabolic load increasing with the copy number of the circuits. Notably, we show that variation of copy number, an increase from low to medium copy, caused different types of change observed in the behavior of components in the AND gate circuit leading to the unbalance of the two gate-inputs and thus counterintuitive output attenuation. The study demonstrates the circuit plasmid copy number is a key factor that can dramatically affect the orthogonality, burden and functionality of the heterologous circuits in the host chassis. The results provide important guidance for future efforts to design orthogonal and robust gene circuits with minimal unwanted interaction and burden to their host.},

abstract = {Protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) copy numbers vary from cell to cell in isogenic bacterial populations. However, these molecules often exist in low copy numbers and are difficult to detect in single cells. We carried out quantitative system-wide analyses of protein and mRNA expression in individual cells with single-molecule sensitivity using a newly constructed yellow fluorescent protein fusion library for Escherichia coli. We found that almost all protein number distributions can be described by the gamma distribution with two fitting parameters which, at low expression levels, have clear physical interpretations as the transcription rate and protein burst size. At high expression levels, the distributions are dominated by extrinsic noise. We found that a single cell's protein and mRNA copy numbers for any given gene are uncorrelated.},

However, under certain conditions, only a small amount of material is available, which requires more sensitive techniques that can preferably be used at the single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital gene expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75{\%} (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5 reads. Moreover, 8-19{\%} of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1-/- and Ago2-/- (Eif2c2-/-) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.},

abstract = {Isogenic E. coli cells growing in a constant environment display significant variability in growth rates, division sizes, and generation times. The guiding principle appears to be that each cell, during one generation, adds a size increment that is uncorrelated to its birth size. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this “adder” behavior by mapping the chromosome replication cycle to the division cycle of individual cells using fluorescence microscopy. We have found that initiation of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per chromosome independent of a cell's birth volume and growth rate. Each initiation event is coupled to a division event after a growth-rate-dependent time. We formalize our findings in a model showing that cell-to-cell variation in division timing and cell size is mainly driven by variations in growth rate. The model also explains why fast-growing cells display adder behavior and correctly predict deviations from the adder behavior at slow growth.},

abstract = {Gene expression noise (heterogeneity) leads to phenotypic diversity among isogenic individual cells. Our current understanding of gene expression noise is mostly limited to transcription, as separating translational noise from transcriptional noise has been challenging. It also remains unclear how translational heterogeneity originates. Using a transcription-normalized reporter system, we discovered that stop codon readthrough is heterogeneous among single cells, and individual cells with higher UGA readthrough grow faster from stationary phase. Our work also revealed that individual cells with lower protein synthesis levels exhibited higher UGA readthrough, which was confirmed with ribosome-targeting antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol). Further experiments and mathematical modeling suggest that varied competition between ternary complexes and release factors perturbs the UGA readthrough level. Our results indicate that fluctuations in the concentrations of translational components lead to UGA readthrough heterogeneity among single cells, which enhances phenotypic diversity of the genetically identical population and facilitates its adaptation to changing environments.},

In this paper, we explore whether it is possible to transfer the knowledge gained from previous optimizations to new tasks in order to find optimal hyperparameter set- tings more efficiently. Our approach is based on extending multi-task Gaussian processes to the framework of Bayesian optimization. We show that this method significantly speeds up the optimization process when compared to the standard single-task approach. We further propose a straightforward extension of our al- gorithm in order to jointly minimize the average error across multiple tasks and demonstrate how this can be used to greatly speed up k-fold cross-validation. Lastly, we propose an adaptation of a recently developed acquisition function, en- tropy search, to the cost-sensitive, multi-task setting. We demonstrate the utility of this new acquisition function by leveraging a small dataset to explore hyper- parameter settings for a large dataset. Our algorithm dynamically chooses which dataset to query in order to yield the most information per unit cost.},

abstract = {The Bacillus subtilis glycine riboswitch comprises tandem glycine-binding aptamers and a putative terminator stem followed by the gcvT operon. Gene expression is regulated via the sensing of glycine. However, we found that the riboswitch behaves in a "glycine-independent" manner in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ethylene glycol. The effect is related to the formation of a terminator stem within the expression platform under such conditions. The results revealed that increasing PEG stabilized the structure of the terminator stem. By contrast, the addition of ethylene glycol destabilized the terminator stem. PEG and ethylene glycol have opposite effects on transcription as well as on stable terminator stem formation. The glycine-independency of the riboswitch and the effects of such glycols might shed light on the evolution of riboswitches. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {In exponentially growing bacteria, expression of heterologous protein impedes cellular growth rates. Quantitative understanding of the relationship between expression and growth rate will advance our ability to forward engineer bacteria, important for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications. Recently, a work described a scaling model based on optimal allocation of ribosomes for protein translation. This model quantitatively predicts a linear relationship between microbial growth rate and heterologous protein expression with no free parameters. With the aim of validating this model, we have rigorously quantified the fitness cost of gene expression by using a library of synthetic constitutive promoters to drive expression of two separate proteins (eGFP and amiE) in E. coli in different strains and growth media. In all cases, we demonstrate that the fitness cost is consistent with the previous findings. We expand upon the previous theory by introducing a simple promoter activity model to quantitatively predict how basal promoter strength relates to growth rate and protein expression. We then estimate the amount of protein expression needed to support high flux through a heterologous metabolic pathway and predict the sizable fitness cost associated with enzyme production. This work has broad implications across applied biological sciences because it allows for prediction of the interplay between promoter strength, protein expression, and the resulting cost to microbial growth rates.},

abstract = {One fundamental challenge in synthetic biology is the lack of quantitative tools that accurately describe and predict the behaviours of engineered gene circuits. This challenge arises from multiple factors, among which the complex interdependence of circuits and their host is a leading cause. Here we present a gene circuit modelling framework that explicitly integrates circuit behaviours with host physiology through bidirectional circuit-host coupling. The framework consists of a coarse-grained but mechanistic description of host physiology that involves dynamic resource partitioning, multilayered circuit-host coupling including both generic and system-specific interactions, and a detailed kinetic module of exogenous circuits. We showed that, following training, the framework was able to capture and predict a large set of experimental data concerning the host and its foreign gene overexpression. To demonstrate its utility, we applied the framework to examine a growth-modulating feedback circuit whose dynamics is qualitatively altered by circuit-host interactions. Using an extended version of the framework, we further systematically revealed the behaviours of a toggle switch across scales from single-cell dynamics to population structure and to spatial ecology. This work advances our quantitative understanding of gene circuit behaviours and also benefits the rational design of synthetic gene networks.},

abstract = {Epistatic interactions can frustrate and shape evolutionary change. Indeed, phenotypes may fail to evolve when essential mutations are only accessible through positive selection if they are fixed simultaneously. How environmental variability affects such constraints is poorly understood. Here, we studied genetic constraints in fixed and fluctuating environments using the Escherichia coli lac operon as a model system for genotype-environment interactions. We found that, in different fixed environments, all trajectories that were reconstructed by applying point mutations within the transcription factor-operator interface became trapped at suboptima, where no additional improvements were possible. Paradoxically, repeated switching between these same environments allows unconstrained adaptation by continuous improvements. This evolutionary mode is explained by pervasive cross-environmental tradeoffs that reposition the peaks in such a way that trapped genotypes can repeatedly climb ascending slopes and hence, escape adaptive stasis. Using a Markov approach, we developed a mathematical framework to quantify the landscape-crossing rates and show that this ratchet-like adaptive mechanism is robust in a wide spectrum of fluctuating environments. Overall, this study shows that genetic constraints can be overcome by environmental change and that cross-environmental tradeoffs do not necessarily impede but also, can facilitate adaptive evolution. Because tradeoffs and environmental variability are ubiquitous in nature, we speculate this evolutionary mode to be of general relevance.},

abstract = {Cells usually respond to changing growth conditions with a change in the specific growth rate ($\mu$) and adjustment of their proteome to adapt and maintain metabolic efficiency. Description of the principles behind proteome resource allocation is important for understanding metabolic regulation in response to changing $\mu$. Thus, we analysed the proteome resource allocation dynamics of Escherichia coli into different metabolic processes in response to changing $\mu$. E. coli was grown on minimal and defined rich media in steady state continuous cultures at different $\mu$ and characterised combining two LC-MS/MS-based proteomics methods: stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and intensity based label-free absolute quantification. We detected slowly growing cells investing more proteome resources in energy generation and carbohydrate transport and metabolism whereas for achieving faster growth cells needed to devote most resources to translation and processes closely related to the protein synthesis pipeline. Furthermore, down-regulation of energy generation and carbohydrate metabolism proteins with faster growth displayed very similar expression dynamics with the global transcriptional regulator CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein), pointing to a dominant protein resource allocating role of this protein. Our data also suggest that acetate overflow may be the result of global proteome resource optimisation as cells saved proteome resources by switching from fully respiratory to respiro-fermentative growth. The presented results give a quantitative overview of how E. coli adjusts its proteome to achieve faster growth and in future could contribute to the design of more efficient cell factories through proteome optimisation.},

abstract = {Laboratory-created small-molecule-dependent inteins enable protein structure and function to be controlled posttranslationally in living cells. Previously we evolved inteins that splice efficiently in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only in the presence of the cell-permeable small molecule 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT). In mammalian cells, however, these inteins exhibited lower splicing efficiencies and slower splicing in the presence of 4-HT, as well as higher background splicing in the absence of 4-HT. Here we further evolved ligand-dependent inteins in yeast at 30°C and 37°C. The resulting second-generation evolved inteins exhibit substantially improved splicing yields and kinetics. The improvements carried over to mammalian cells, in which the newly evolved inteins spliced with substantially greater (∼2- to 8-fold) efficiency while maintaining low background splicing levels. These second-generation inteins augment the promise of ligand-dependent protein splicing for probing protein function in mammalian cells. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy studies of bacteria provide unique insights into the mechanisms of cellular processes and protein machineries in ways that are unrivalled by any other technique. With the cost of microscopes dropping and the availability of fully automated microscopes, the volume of microscopy data produced has increased tremendously. These developments have moved the bottleneck of throughput from image acquisition and sample preparation to data analysis. Furthermore, requirements for analysis procedures have become more stringent given the demand of various journals to make data and analysis procedures available. To address these issues we have developed a new data analysis package for analysis of fluorescence microscopy data from rod-like cells. Our software ColiCoords structures microscopy data at the single-cell level and implements a coordinate system describing each cell. This allows for the transformation of Cartesian coordinates from transmission light and fluorescence images and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data to cellular coordinates. Using this transformation, many cells can be combined to increase the statistical power of fluorescence microscopy datasets of any kind. ColiCoords is open source, implemented in the programming language Python, and is extensively documented. This allows for modifications for specific needs or to inspect and publish data analysis procedures. By providing a format that allows for easy sharing of code and associated data, we intend to promote open and reproducible research. The source code and documentation can be found via the project's GitHub page.},

To unify efforts, here we have engineered a cross-species expression resource that enables circuits and pathways to reuse the same genetic parts, while functioning similarly across diverse organisms. Our engineered system combines mixed feedback control loops and cross-species translation signals to autonomously self-regulate expression of an orthogonal polymerase without host-specific promoters, achieving nontoxic and tuneable gene expression in diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combining 50 characterized system variants with mechanistic modelling, we show how the cross-species expression resource's dynamics, capacity and toxicity are controlled by the control loops' architecture and feedback strengths. We also demonstrate one application of the resource by reusing the same genetic parts to express a biosynthesis pathway in both model and non-model hosts.},

Theory predicts that independence to copy number can be achieved by using an incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) if the negative regulation is perfectly non-cooperative. We engineered iFFLs into Escherichia coli promoters using transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs). These promoters had near-identical expression in different genome locations and plasmids, even when their copy number was perturbed by genomic mutations or changes in growth medium composition. We applied the stabilized promoters to show that a three-gene metabolic pathway to produce deoxychromoviridans could retain function without re-tuning when the stabilized-promoter-driven genes were moved from a plasmid into the genome.},

In Escherichia coli, the SMC complex MukBEF plays roles in chromosome segregation and organization. We used single-molecule millisecond multicolor fluorescence microscopy of live bacteria to reveal that a dimer of dimeric fluorescent MukBEF molecules acts as the minimal functional unit. On average, 8 to 10 of these complexes accumulated as "spots" in one to three discrete chromosome-associated regions of the cell, where they formed higher-order structures. Functional MukBEF within spots exchanged with freely diffusing complexes at a rate of one complex about every 50 seconds in reactions requiring adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Thus, by functioning in pairs, MukBEF complexes may undergo multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis without being released from DNA, analogous to the behavior of well-characterized molecular motors.},

In particular, it is of utmost importance to model the reaction of the cellular chassis when expressing heterologous systems. We constructed a mathematical model for the response of a bacterial cell chassis under heterologous expression. For this, we relied on previous characterization of the growth-rate dependence on cellular resource availability (in this case, DNA and RNA polymerases and ribosomes). Accordingly, we estimated the maximum capacities of the cell for heterologous expression to be 46{\%} of the total RNA and the 33{\%} of the total protein. To experimentally validate our model, we engineered two genetic constructions that involved the constitutive expression of a fluorescent reporter in a vector with a tunable origin of replication. We performed fluorescent measurements using population and single-cell fluorescent measurements. Our model predicted cell growth for several heterologous constructions under five different culture conditions and various plasmid copy numbers with significant accuracy, and confirmed that ribosomes act as the limiting resource. Our study also confirmed that the bacterial response to synthetic gene expression could be understood in terms of the requirement for cellular resources and could be predicted from relevant cellular parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

GFP fluorescence is stable, species-independent, and can be monitored noninvasively in living cells by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or macroscopic imaging techniques. Owing to the presence of a phenol group on the chromophore, most GFP variants display pH-sensitive absorption and fluorescence bands. Such behavior has been exploited to genetically engineer encodable pH indicators for studies of pH regulation within specific intracellular compartments that cannot be probed using conventional pH-sensitive dyes. These pH indicators contributed to shedding light on a number of cell functions for which intracellular pH is an important modulator.

The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the 'repressilator,' a three-node synthetic oscillator. We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide synchronized oscillations and 95{\%} of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hours. Oscillation periods in cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior.},

To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift, we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients, we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity, but weak or asymmetric mutualism is over-whelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial, slowing growth and reducing diversity. Theoretical modeling us-ing experimentally measured parameters predicts the size of demixed regions and how strong mutualism must be to survive a spatial expansion.},

abstract = {A major problem in the design of synthetic genetic circuits is robustness to perturbations and uncertainty. Because of this, there have been significant efforts in recent years in finding approaches to implement integral control in genetic circuits. Integral controllers have the unique ability to make the output of a process adapt perfectly to disturbances. However, implementing an integral controller is challenging in living cells. This is because a key aspect of any integral controller is a ‘memory' element that stores the accumulation (integral) of the error between the output and its desired set-point. The ability to realize such a memory element in living cells is fundamentally challenged by the fact that all biomolecules dilute as cells grow, resulting in a ‘leaky' memory that gradually fades away. As a consequence, the adaptation property is lost. Here, we propose a general principle for designing integral controllers such that the performance is practically unaffected by dilution. In particular, we mathematically prove that if the reactions implementing the integral controller are all much faster than dilution, then the adaptation error due to integration leakiness becomes negligible. We exemplify this design principle with two synthetic genetic circuits aimed at reaching adaptation of gene expression to fluctuations in cellular resources. Our results provide concrete guidance on the biomolecular processes that are most appropriate for implementing integral controllers in living cells.},

abstract = {One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.},

abstract = {DNA assembly forms the cornerstone of modern synthetic biology. Despite the numerous available methods, scarless multi-fragment assembly of large plasmids remains challenging. Furthermore, the up-coming wave in molecular biological automation de-mands a rethinking of how we perform DNA assem-bly. To streamline automation workflow and minimize operator intervention, a non-enzymatic assembly method is highly desirable. Here, we report the op-timization and operationalization of a process called Twin-Primer Assembly (TPA), which is a method to assemble polymerase chain reaction-amplified frag-ments into a plasmid without the use of enzymes. TPA is capable of assembling a 7 kb plasmid from 10 fragments at ∼80{\%} fidelity and a 31 kb plasmid from five fragments at ∼50{\%} fidelity. TPA cloning is scarless and sequence independent. Even without the use of enzymes, the performance of TPA is on par with some of the best in vitro assembly meth-ods currently available. TPA should be an invaluable addition to a synthetic biologist's toolbox.},

abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes is a standard method for identification of microorganisms in environmental samples. Apart from its value as a phylogenetic marker ribosomal RNA has always been the favoured target molecule for FISH because of its abundance in all cells, whereas plasmids and DNA were regarded as unsuitable targets because of their low copy number. Here we present an improved FISH technique, which is based on polynucleotide probes. It goes beyond the detection of high copy intracellular nucleic acids such as rRNA (up to 10(4)-10(5) copies per cell) and allows for the first time the in situ detection of individual genes or gene fragments on plasmids (10(1)-10(3) copies per cell) and chromosomal DNA ({\textless}10 copies per cell) in a single cell. Using E. coli as model organism we were able to detect in situ cells harbouring the antibiotic resistance gene beta lactamase on high, medium and low copy plasmids as well as the chromosomal encoded housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, we detected the prepilin peptidase gene xpsO in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in situ. Because of the characteristic hybridization signal obtained with this method--a halo-like, ring-shaped concentration of fluorescence in the cell periphery--we coined the term RING-FISH (recognition of individual genes) to differentiate it from conventional FISH.},

abstract = {We recently developed base editing, the programmable conversion of target C:G base pairs to T:A without inducing double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) or requiring homology-directed repair using engineered fusions of Cas9 variants and cytidine deaminases. Over the past year, the third-generation base editor (BE3) and related technologies have been successfully used by many researchers in a wide range of organisms. The product distribution of base editing—the frequency with which the target C:G is converted to mixtures of undesired by-products, along with the desired T:A product—varies in a target site–dependent manner. We characterize determinants of base editing outcomes in human cells and establish that the formation of undesired products is dependent on uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) and is more likely to occur at target sites containing only a single C within the base editing activity window. We engineered CDA1-BE3 and AID-BE3, which use cytidine deaminase homologs that increase base editing efficiency for some sequences. On the basis of these observations, we engineered fourth-generation base editors (BE4 and SaBE4) that increase the efficiency of C:G to T:A base editing by approximately 50{\%}, while halving the frequency of undesired by-products compared to BE3. Fusing BE3, BE4, SaBE3, or SaBE4 to Gam, a bacteriophage Mu protein that binds DSBs greatly reduces indel formation during base editing, in most cases to below 1.5{\%}, and further improves product purity. BE4, SaBE4, BE4-Gam, and SaBE4-Gam represent the state of the art in C:G-to-T:A base editing, and we recommend their use in future efforts.},

abstract = {The orchestrated action of genes controls complex biological phenotypes, yet the systematic discovery of gene and drug combinations that modulate these phenotypes in human cells is labor intensive and challenging to scale. Here, we created a platform for the massively parallel screening of barcoded combinatorial gene perturbations in human cells and translated these hits into effective drug combinations. This technology leverages the simplicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for multiplexed targeting of specific genomic loci and the versatility of combinatorial genetics en masse (CombiGEM) to rapidly assemble barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be tracked with high-throughput sequencing. We applied CombiGEM-CRISPR to create a library of 23,409 barcoded dual guide-RNA (gRNA) combinations and then perform a high-throughput pooled screen to identify gene pairs that inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth when they were targeted. We validated the growth-inhibiting effects of specific gene sets, including epigenetic regulators KDM4C/BRD4 and KDM6B/BRD4, via individual assays with CRISPR-Cas-based knockouts and RNA-interference-based knockdowns. We also tested small-molecule drug pairs directed against our pairwise hits and showed that they exerted synergistic antiproliferative effects against ovarian cancer cells. We envision that the CombiGEM-CRISPR platform will be applicable to a broad range of biological settings and will accelerate the systematic identification of genetic combinations and their translation into novel drug combinations that modulate complex human disease phenotypes.},

Here, we perform a detailed analysis of the interaction between constitutive expression from a test circuit and cell-growth properties in a subset of genetic variants of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Differences in generic cellular parameters such as ribosome availability and growth rate are the main determinants (89{\%}) of strain-specific differences of circuit performance in laboratory-adapted strains but are responsible for only 35{\%} of expression variation across 88 mutants of E.coli BW25113. In the latter strains, we identify specific cell functions, such as nitrogen metabolism, that directly modulate circuit behavior. Finally, we expose aspects of carbon metabolism that act in a strain- and sequence-specific manner. This method of dissecting interactions between host factors and heterologous circuits enables the discovery of mechanisms of interference necessary for the development of design principles for predictable cellular engineering},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of migration rate and of the thermotactic sensitivity of pseudoplasmodia of Dictyostelium discoideum has been measured. Migration rate increases with temperature to 20 degrees, is temperature insensitive from 20 degrees to 27.5 degrees, and decreases with temperature to 29 degrees, above which point migration ceases. However, pseudoplasmodia formed from cells grown at 23.5 degrees are thermotactic only from 22 degrees to 27.5 degrees. Thus, a temperature dependence of migration rate is not sufficient to explain thermotaxis. Because random lateral movements by the pseudoplasmodia have not been observed, the measurement of the temperature gradient appears to be spatial rather than temporal, with a half-maximal thermotactic response to a temperature gradient of about 0.04 degree/cm, or 0.0004 degree across an average pseudoplasmodium. Thermotactic sensitivity is adaptive, with pseudoplasmodia formed from cells grown at 20 degrees capable of thermotaxis at temperatures lower than cells grown at 23.5 degrees.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing enhances our understanding of the biological world by providing blueprints for the evolutionary and functional diversity that shapes the biosphere. However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called 'microbial dark matter'. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20{\%} of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In bacteria, translational coupling provides a genetically encoded mechanism to control expression level ratios within multi-cistronic operons. We have developed a sequence-to-function biophysical model of translational coupling to predict expression level ratios in natural operons and to design synthetic operons with desired expression level ratios. To quantitatively measure ribosome re-initiation rates, we designed and characterized 22 bi-cistronic operon variants with systematically modified intergenic distances and upstream translation rates. We then derived a thermodynamic free energy model to calculate de novo initiation rates as a result of ribosome-assisted unfolding of intergenic RNA structures. The complete biophysical model has only five free parameters, but was able to accurately predict downstream translation rates for 120 synthetic bi-cistronic and tri-cistronic operons with rationally designed intergenic regions and systematically increased upstream translation rates. The biophysical model also accurately predicted the translation rates of the nine protein atp operon, compared to ribosome profiling measurements. Altogether, the biophysical model quantitatively predicts how translational coupling controls protein expression levels in synthetic and natural bacterial operons, providing a deeper understanding of an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism and offering the ability to rationally engineer operons with desired behaviors.},

abstract = {Induction of $\beta$-galactosidase from high copy-number plasmids was found to reduce the synthesis of other cellular proteins in Escherichia coli. The reduction depends on the protein in question and on the induction level of the $\beta$-galactosidase. It could be observed transiently within one minute after induction and in some cases also during steady-state induction. Our interpretation is that the concentration of the free ribosomal subunits decreases after induction, leading to an increased competition among the individual ribosome binding sites for ribosomes. The immediate reduction in the synthesis rate of individual proteins after induction of $\beta$-galactosidase was used as an assay to measure in vivo the efficiency of a ribosome binding site. These efficiencies were compared to the calculated affinities between the ribosome binding site of specific mRNA species and the 3' end of 16 S RNA. For several mRNAs with similar Shine-Dalgarno sequences, the sensitivity to competition differed twofold. Our results show, that both transiently during induction of lacZ and also at very high steady-state expression levels, the expression from reporter genes, including the lacZ gene itself, does not reflect the levels of the mRNAs in a simple way. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology aims to make biology easier to engineer and focuses on the design and construction of core components that can be modeled, understood, and tuned to meet specific performance criteria, and the assembly of these smaller parts and devices into larger integrated systems to solve specific problems. Here, we designed and engineered a multicolor fluorescent reporter toolbox to simultaneously monitor the activities of multiple genes in single cells. The toolbox contained standardized and well-characterized genetic building blocks for the convenient and reproducible assembly of multiple promoter-reporter fusions (ranging from 1 to 4) into a single plasmid. Given the common problem of spectral crosstalk among multiple fluorescent proteins, we deciphered multiple spectral signatures within cells through a deduced linear unmixing algorithm. Our approach enabled the quantification of gene expression with direct FP concentrations, instead of mix-contributed fluorescence intensities, thus enabling true signal separation with high confidence. This approach performed well in the imaging of mixing cells with single FP labels. Additionally, combining with the multicolor toolbox, we succeeded in simultaneously monitoring the genetic dynamics of four selected quorum-sensing genes in response to the induction of two exogenously added autoinducers and were able to examine gene regulatory connections within the QS signaling network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, this synthetic framework (i.e., the genetic toolbox and the well-evaluated approach of spectral correction) will be useful for applied synthetic biology projects, multicolor imaging, and analyzing interactions of multiple genes of natural genetic networks or assembling synthetic ones.},

@article{Esvelt2011a,
abstract = {Laboratory evolution has generated many biomolecules with desired properties, but a single round of mutation, gene expression, screening or selection, and replication typically requires days or longer with frequent human intervention. Because evolutionary success is dependent on the total number of rounds performed, a means of performing laboratory evolution continuously and rapidly could dramatically enhance its effectiveness. Although researchers have accelerated individual steps in the evolutionary cycle, the only previous example of continuous directed evolution was the landmark study of Wright and Joyce, who continuously evolved RNA ligase ribozymes with an in vitro replication cycle that unfortunately cannot be easily adapted to other biomolecules. Here we describe a system that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in Escherichia coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified bacteriophage life cycle in a manner that is dependent on the activity of interest. Dozens of rounds of evolution can occur in a single day of PACE without human intervention. Using PACE, we evolved T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) variants that recognize a distinct promoter, initiate transcripts with ATP instead of GTP, and initiate transcripts with CTP. In one example, PACE executed 200 rounds of protein evolution over the course of 8 days. Starting from undetectable activity levels in two of these cases, enzymes with each of the three target activities emerged in less than 1 week of PACE. In all three cases, PACE-evolved polymerase activities exceeded or were comparable to that of the wild-type T7 RNAP on its wild-type promoter, representing improvements of up to several hundred-fold. By greatly accelerating laboratory evolution, PACE may provide solutions to otherwise intractable directed evolution problems and address novel questions about molecular evolution.},

This global dependence complicates the quantitative understanding of gene regulation and the design of synthetic gene circuits. In bacteria these global effects can often be described as a dependence on the growth rate. Here we discuss how growth-rate dependence can be incorporated in mathematical models of gene expression by comparing data for unregulated genes with the predictions of different theoretical descriptions of growth-rate dependence. We argue that a realistic description of growth effects requires a growth-rate dependent protein synthesis rate in addition to dilution by growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hintsche and Klumpp; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {It has been shown experimentally that competition for limited translational resources by upstream mRNAs can lead to an anticorrelation between protein counts. Here, we investigate a stochastic model for this phenomenon, in which gene transcripts of different types compete for a finite pool of ribosomes. Throughout, we utilize concepts from the theory of multiclass queues to describe a qualitative shift in protein count statistics as the system transitions from being underloaded (ribosomes exceed transcripts in number) to being overloaded (transcripts exceed ribosomes in number). The exact analytical solution of a simplified stochastic model, in which the numbers of competing mRNAs and ribosomes are fixed, exhibits weak positive correlations between steady-state protein counts when total transcript count slightly exceeds ribosome count, whereas the solution can exhibit strong negative correlations when total transcript count significantly exceeds ribosome count. Extending this analysis, we find approximate but reasonably accurate solutions for a more realistic model, in which abundances of mRNAs and ribosomes are allowed to fluctuate randomly. Here, ribosomal fluctuations contribute positively and mRNA fluctuations contribute negatively to correlations, and when mRNA fluctuations dominate ribosomal fluctuations, a strong anticorrelation extremum reliably occurs near the transition from the underloaded to the overloaded regime. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Early detection of colonic polyps can prevent up to 90{\%} of colorectal cancer deaths. Conventional colonoscopy readily detects the majority of premalignant lesions, which exhibit raised morphology. However, lesions that are flat and depressed are often undetected using this method. Therefore, there is a need for molecular-based contrast agents to improve detection rates over conventional colonoscopy. We evaluated a quenched fluorescent activity-based probe (qABP; BMV109) that targets multiple cysteine cathepsins that are overexpressed in intestinal dysplasia in a genetic model of spontaneous intestinal polyp formation and in a chemically induced model of colorectal carcinoma. We found that the qABP selectively targets cysteine cathepsins, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity for intestinal tumors in mice and humans. Additionally, the qABP can be administered by either intravenous injection or by local delivery to the colon, making it a highly valuable tool for improved detection of colorectal lesions using fluorescence-guided colonoscopy.},

abstract = {Historical and projected climate trends for high latitudes show substantial temporal and spatial variability. To identify uncertainties in simulating carbon (C) dynamics for pan-Arctic tundra, we compare the historical and projected responses of tundra C storage from 1921 to 2100 between simulations by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) for the pan-Arctic and the Kuparuk River Basin, which was the focus of an integrated study of C dynamics from 1994 to 1996. In the historical period from 1921 to 1994, the responses of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (RH) simulated for the Kuparuk River Basin and the pan-Arctic are correlated with the same factors; NPP is positively correlated with net nitrogen mineralization (NMIN) and RH is negatively correlated with mean annual soil moisture. In comparison to the historical period, the spatially aggregated responses of NPP and RH for the Kuparuk River Basin and the pan-Arctic in our simulations for the projected period have different sensitivities to temperature, soil moisture and NMIN. In addition to being sensitive to soil moisture during the projected period, RH is also sensitive to temperature and there is a significant correlation between RH and NMIN. We interpret the increases in NPP during the projected period as being driven primarily by increases in NMIN, and that the correlation between NPP and temperature in the projected period is a result primarily of the causal linkage between temperature, RH, and NMIN. Although similar factors appear to be controlling simulated regional-and biome-scale C dynamics, simulated C dynamics at the two scales differ in magnitude with higher increases in C storage simulated for the Kuparuk River Basin than for the pan-Arctic at the end of the historical period and throughout the projected period. Also, the results of the simulations indicate that responses of C storage show different climate sensitivities at regional and pan-Arctic spatial scales and that these sensitivities change across the temporal scope of the simulations. The results of the TEM simulations indicate that the scaling of C dynamics to a region of arctic tundra may not represent C dynamics of pan-Arctic tundra because of the limited spatial variation in climate and vegetation within a region relative to the pan-Arctic. For reducing uncertainties, our analyses highlight the importance of incorporating the understanding gained from process-level studies of C dynamics in a region of arctic tundra into process-based models that simulate C dynamics in a spatially explicit fashion across the spatial domain of pan-Arctic tundra. Also, efforts to improve gridded datasets of historical climate for the pan-Arctic would advance the ability to assess the responses of C dynamics for pan-Arctic tundra in a more realistic fashion. A major challenge will be to incorporate topographic controls over soil moisture in assessing the response of C storage for pan-Arctic tundra.},

abstract = {Sequencing of a single-cell genome requires DNA amplification, a process prone to introducing bias and errors into the amplified genome. Here we introduce a novel multiple displacement amplification (MDA) method based on the unique DNA primase features of Thermus thermophilus (Tth) PrimPol. TthPrimPol displays a potent primase activity preferring dNTPs as substrates unlike conventional primases. A combination of TthPrimPol's unique ability to synthesize DNA primers with the highly processive Phi29 DNA polymerase ($\Phi$29DNApol) enables near-complete whole genome amplification from single cells. This novel method demonstrates superior breadth and evenness of genome coverage, high reproducibility, excellent single-nucleotide variant (SNV) detection rates with low allelic dropout (ADO) and low chimera formation as exemplified by sequencing HEK293 cells. Moreover, copy number variant (CNV) calling yields superior results compared with random primer-based MDA methods. The advantages of this method, which we named TruePrime, promise to facilitate and improve single-cell genomic analysis.},

abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number - in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recent advances in quantitative single-cell analysis revealed large diversity in gene expression levels between individual cells, which could affect the physiology and/or fate of each cell. In contrast, for most metabolites, the concentrations were only measureable as ensemble averages of many cells. In living cells, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a critically important metabolite that powers many intracellular reactions. Quantitative measurement of the absolute ATP concentration in individual cells has not been achieved because of the lack of reliable methods. In this study, we developed a new genetically-encoded ratiometric fluorescent ATP indicator a € QUEENa €, which is composed of a single circularly-permuted fluorescent protein and a bacterial ATP binding protein. Unlike previous FRET-based indicators, QUEEN was apparently insensitive to bacteria growth rate changes. Importantly, intracellular ATP concentrations of numbers of bacterial cells calculated from QUEEN fluorescence were almost equal to those from firefly luciferase assay. Thus, QUEEN is suitable for quantifying the absolute ATP concentration inside bacteria cells. Finally, we found that, even for a genetically-identical Escherichia coli cell population, absolute concentrations of intracellular ATP were significantly diverse between individual cells from the same culture, by imaging QUEEN signals from single cells.},

Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.},

abstract = {A central aim of cell biology was to understand the strategy of gene expression in response to the environment. Here, we study gene expression response to metabolic challenges in exponentially growing Escherichia coli using mass spectrometry. Despite enormous complexity in the details of the underlying regulatory network, we find that the proteome partitions into several coarse-grained sectors, with each sector's total mass abundance exhibiting positive or negative linear relations with the growth rate. The growth rate-dependent components of the proteome fractions comprise about half of the proteome by mass, and their mutual dependencies can be characterized by a simple flux model involving only two effective parameters. The success and apparent generality of this model arises from tight coordination between proteome partition and metabolism, suggesting a principle for resource allocation in proteome economy of the cell. This strategy of global gene regulation should serve as a basis for future studies on gene expression and constructing synthetic biological circuits. Coarse graining may be an effective approach to derive predictive phenomenological models for other 'omics' studies.},

The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays.

Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication.

abstract = {Most genes change expression levels across conditions, but it is unclear which of these changes represents specific regulation and what determines their quantitative degree. Here, we accurately measured activities of ∼900 S. cerevisiae and ∼1800 E. coli promoters using fluorescent reporters. We show that in both organisms 60-90{\%} of promoters change their expression between conditions by a constant global scaling factor that depends only on the conditions and not on the promoter's identity. Quantifying such global effects allows precise characterization of specific regulation - promoters deviating from the global scale line. These are organized into few functionally related groups that also adhere to scale lines and preserve their relative activities across conditions. Thus, only several scaling factors suffice to accurately describe genome-wide expression profiles across conditions. We present a parameter-free passive resource allocation model that quantitatively accounts for the global scaling factors. It suggests that many changes in expression across conditions result from global effects and not specific regulation, and provides means for quantitative interpretation of expression profiles.{\textcopyright}2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Cells contain a finite set of resources that must be distributed across many processes to ensure survival. Among them, the largest proportion of cellular resources is dedicated to protein translation. Synthetic biology often exploits these resources in executing orthogonal genetic circuits, yet the burden this places on the cell is rarely considered. Here, we develop a minimal model of ribosome allocation dynamics capturing the demands on translation when expressing a synthetic construct together with endogenous genes required for the maintenance of cell physiology. Critically, it contains three key variables related to design parameters of the synthetic construct covering transcript abundance, translation initiation rate, and elongation time. We show that model-predicted changes in ribosome allocation closely match experimental shifts in synthetic protein expression rate and cellular growth. Intriguingly, the model is also able to accurately infer transcript levels and translation times after further exposure to additional ambient stress. Our results demonstrate that a simple model of resource allocation faithfully captures the redistribution of protein synthesis resources when faced with the burden of synthetic gene expression and environmental stress. The tractable nature of the model makes it a versatile tool for exploring the guiding principles of efficient heterologous expression and the indirect interactions that can arise between synthetic circuits and their host chassis because of competition for shared translational resources.},

abstract = {OmpR and EnvZ comprise a two-component system that regulates the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. EnvZ is autophosphorylated by intracellular ATP on a histidine residue, and it transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartic acid residue of OmpR. EnvZ can also dephosphorylate phospho-OmpR (OmpR-P) to control the cellular level of OmpR-P. At low osmolarity, OmpR-P levels are low because of either low EnvZ kinase or high EnvZ phosphatase activities. At high osmolarity, OmpR-P is elevated. It has been proposed that EnvZ phosphatase is the activity that is regulated by osmolarity. OmpR is a two-domain response regulator; phosphorylation of OmpR increases its affinity for DNA, and DNA binding stimulates phosphorylation. The step that is affected by DNA depends upon the phosphodonor employed. In the present work, we have used fluorescence anisotropy and phosphotransfer assays to examine OmpR interactions with EnvZ. Our results indicate that phosphorylation greatly reduces the affinity of OmpR for the kinase, whereas DNA does not affect their interaction. The results presented cast serious doubts on the role of the EnvZ phosphatase in response to signaling in vivo.},

However, the expression of foreign proteins from engineered constructs is an unnatural burden that cells are not adapted for.

We observed that native promoters related to the heat-shock response activated expression rapidly in response to synthetic expression, regardless of the construct. Using these promoters, we built a dCas9-based feedback-regulation system that automatically adjusts the expression of a synthetic construct in response to burden. Cells equipped with this general-use controller maintained their capacity for native gene expression to ensure robust growth and thus outperformed unregulated cells in terms of protein yield in batch production. This engineered feedback is to our knowledge the first example of a universal, burden-based biomolecular control system and is modular, tunable and portable.},

abstract = {Orthogonal, parallel and independent, systems are one key foundation for synthetic biology. The synthesis of orthogonal systems that are uncoupled from evolutionary constraints, and selectively abstracted from cellular regulation, is an emerging approach to making biology more amenable to engineering. Here, we combine orthogonal transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and translation by orthogonal ribosomes (O-ribosomes), creating an orthogonal gene expression pathway in Escherichia coli. We design and implement compact, orthogonal gene expression networks. In particular we focus on creating transcription- translation feed-forward loops (FFLs). The transcription-translation FFLs reported cannot be created by using the cells' gene expression machinery and introduce information-processing delays on the order of hours into gene expression. Were factor the rRNA operon, uncoupling the synthesis of the orthogonal 16S rRNA for the O-ribosome from the synthesis and processing of the rest of the rRNA operon, thereby defining a minimal module that can be added to the cell for O-ribosome production. The minimal O-ribosome permits the rational alteration of the delay in an orthogonal gene expression FFL. Overall this work demonstrates that system-level dynamic properties are amenable to rational manipulation and design in orthogonal systems. In the future this system may be further evolved and tuned to provide a spectrum of tailored dynamics in gene expression and investigate the effects of delays in cellular decisionmaking processes.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations1-3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-$\lambda$4, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5,6 and in the decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

Here we examined the influence of interspecies spatial positioning as it relates to biosynthetic activity within structurally diverse uncultured methane-oxidizing consortia by measuring stable isotope incorporation for individual archaeal and bacterial cells to constrain their potential metabolic interactions. In contrast to conventional models of syntrophy based on the passage of molecular intermediates, cellular activities were found to be independent of both species intermixing and distance between syntrophic partners within consortia. A generalized model of electric conductivity between co-associated archaea and bacteria best fit the empirical data. Combined with the detection of large multi-haem cytochromes in the genomes of methanotrophic archaea and the demonstration of redox-dependent staining of the matrix between cells in consortia, these results provide evidence for syntrophic coupling through direct electron transfer.},

Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

abstract = {Recombineering is an efficient method of in vivo genetic engineering applicable to chromosomal as well as episomal replicons in Escherichia coli. This method circumvents the need for most standard in vitro cloning techniques. Recombineering allows construction of DNA molecules with precise junctions without constraints being imposed by restriction enzyme site location. Bacteriophage homologous recombination proteins catalyze these recombineering reactions using double- and single-stranded linear DNA substrates, so-called targeting constructs, introduced by electroporation. Gene knockouts, deletions and point mutations are readily made, gene tags can be inserted and regions of bacterial artificial chromosomes or the E. coli genome can be subcloned by gene retrieval using recombineering. Most of these constructs can be made within about 1 week's time.},

abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic maps can be reconstructed from annotated genome sequence data, biochemical literature, bioinformatic analysis, and strain-specific information. Flux-balance analysis has been useful for qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolic reconstructions. In the past, FBA has typically been performed in one growth condition at a time, thus giving a limited view of the metabolic capabilities of a metabolic network. We have broadened the use of FBA to map the optimal metabolic flux distribution onto a single plane, which is defined by the availability of two key substrates. A finite number of qualitatively distinct patterns of metabolic pathway utilization were identified in this plane, dividing it into discrete phases. The characteristics of these distinct phases are interpreted using ratios of shadow prices in the form of isoclines. The isoclines can be used to classify the state of the metabolic network. This methodology gives rise to a "phase plane" analysis of the metabolic genotype-phenotype relation relevant for a range of growth conditions. Phenotype phase planes (PhPPs) were generated for Escherichia coli growth on two carbon sources (acetate and glucose) at all levels of oxygenation, and the resulting optimal metabolic phenotypes were studied.

abstract = {Translating heterologous proteins places significant burden on host cells, consuming expression resources leading to slower cell growth and productivity. Yet predicting the cost of protein production for any given gene is a major challenge, as multiple processes and factors combine to determine translation efficiency. To enable prediction of the cost of gene expression in bacteria, we describe here a standard cell-free lysate assay that provides a relative measure of resource consumption when a protein coding sequence is expressed. These lysate measurements can then be used with a computational model of translation to predict the in vivo burden placed on growing E. coli cells for a variety of proteins of different functions and lengths. Using this approach, we can predict the burden of expressing multigene operons of different designs and differentiate between the fraction of burden related to gene expression compared to action of a metabolic pathway.},

abstract = {Blood cell formation is classically thought to occur through a hierarchical differentiation process, although recent studies have shown that lineage commitment may occur earlier in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The relevance to human blood diseases and the underlying regulation of these refined models remain poorly understood. By studying a genetic blood disorder, Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), where the majority of mutations affect ribosomal proteins and the erythroid lineage is selectively perturbed, we are able to gain mechanistic insight into how lineage commitment is programmed normally and disrupted in disease. We show that in DBA, the pool of available ribosomes is limited, while ribosome composition remains constant. Surprisingly, this global reduction in ribosome levels more profoundly alters translation of a select subset of transcripts. We show how the reduced translation of select transcripts in HSPCs can impair erythroid lineage commitment, illuminating a regulatory role for ribosome levels in cellular differentiation. A global reduction in ribosome levels in Diamond-Blackfan anemia profoundly alters translation of a select subset of transcripts, thereby impeding erythroid lineage commitment.},

abstract = {Responding to green and red light, certain cyanobacteria change the composition of their light-harvesting pigments, phycoerythrin (PE) and phycocyanin (PC). Although this phenomenon-complementary chromatic adaptation-is well known, the green light-sensing mechanism for PE accumulation is unclear. The filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 (N. punctiforme) regulates PE synthesis in response to green and red light (group II chromatic adaptation). We disrupted the green/red-perceiving histidine-kinase gene (ccaS) or the cognate response regulator gene (ccaR), which are clustered with several PE and PC genes (cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 operon) in N. punctiforme. Under green light, wild-type cells accumulated a significant amount of PE upon induction of cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression, whereas they accumulated little PE with suppression of cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression under red light. Under both green and red light, the ccaS mutant constitutively accumulated some PE with constitutively low cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression, whereas the ccaR mutant accumulated little PE with suppression of cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression. The results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggest that CcaR binds to the promoter region of cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1, which contains a conserved direct-repeat motif. Taken together, the results suggest that CcaS phosphorylates CcaR under green light and that phosphorylated CcaR then induces cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression, leading to PE accumulation. In contrast, CcaS probably represses cpeC-cpcG2-cpeR1 expression by dephosphorylation of CcaR under red light. We also found that the cpeB-cpeA operon is partially regulated by green and red light, suggesting that the green light-induced regulatory protein CpeR1 activates cpeB-cpeA expression together with constitutively induced CpeR2.},

We have shown by long-term labeling that RF synthesis at some level does continue even late in infection, but at a rate not reliably detectable with pulse labels. f1-Infected cells continue to grow and divide while steadily releasing phage. This does not reflect an intracellular steady state. Shortly after infection, the number of RF molecules per infected bacterium increases rapidly and then drops four- to fivefold. We have enumerated the number of RF molecules/IC by two independent techniques: transfection with DNA fractionated on sucrose gradients and by gel electrophoresis. By the transfection assay, we find 30 RF/IC early in infection and 5 RF/IC late in infection; the direct gel measurement yields 50 RF/IC early and 15 RF/IC late. We have also investigated the need for reinfection in maintaining the f1 "steady state" by examining phage growth in f1-transfected female (F-) cells. We find that f1 infection can be maintained in the absence of reinfection, but that uninfected cells segregate at a rate of one cell in every 10 generations. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Synthetic gene circuits are often engineered by considering the host cell as an invariable 'chassis'. Circuit activation, however, may modulate host physiology, which in turn can substantially impact circuit behavior. We illustrate this point by a simple circuit consisting of mutant T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) that activates its own expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although activation by the T7 RNAP is noncooperative, the circuit caused bistable gene expression. This counterintuitive observation can be explained by growth retardation caused by circuit activation, which resulted in nonlinear dilution of T7 RNAP in individual bacteria. Predictions made by models accounting for such effects were verified by further experimental measurements. Our results reveal a new mechanism of generating bistability and underscore the need to account for host physiology modulation when engineering gene circuits. {\textcopyright} 2009 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {In order to construct a green-light-regulated gene expression system for cyanobacteria, we characterized a green-light sensing system derived from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, consisting of the green-light sensing histidine kinase CcaS, the cognate response regulator CcaR, and the promoter of cpcG2 (PcpcG 2 ). CcaS and CcaR act as a genetic controller and activate gene expression from PcpcG 2 with green-light illumination. The green-light induction level of the native PcpcG 2 was investigated using GFPuv as a reporter gene inserted in a broad-host-range vector. A clear induction of protein expression from native PcpcG 2 under green-light illumination was observed; however, the expression level was very low compared with Ptrc , which was reported to act as a constitutive promoter in cyanobacteria. Therefore, a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence derived from the cpcB gene was inserted in the 5' untranslated region of the cpcG2 gene, and the expression level of CcaR was increased. Thus, constructed engineered green-light sensing system resulted in about 40-fold higher protein expression than with the wild-type promoter with a high ON/OFF ratio under green-light illumination. The engineered green-light gene expression system would be a useful genetic tool for controlling gene expression in the emergent cyanobacterial bioprocesses.},

Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating 20,000 mutations genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1{\%} of mutations were lethal; nonlethal mutations displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral mutations with an average cost of 03{\%}.

Here we describe a system for the continuous directed evolution of proteases using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) that links the proteolysis of a target peptide to phage propagation through a protease-activated RNA polymerase (PA-RNAP). We use protease PACE in the presence of danoprevir or asunaprevir, two hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor drug candidates in clinical trials, to continuously evolve HCV protease variants that exhibit up to 30-fold drug resistance in only 1 to 3 days of PACE. The predominant mutations evolved during PACE are mutations observed to arise in human patients treated with danoprevir or asunaprevir, demonstrating that protease PACE can rapidly identify the vulnerabilities of drug candidates to the evolution of clinically relevant drug resistance.},

With the advent of computational systems biology, this endeavour is usually carried out throughin silicotheoretical studies with the aim to guide and complement furtherin vitroandin vivoexperimental efforts. Clearly, what counts is the resultin vivo, not only in terms of maximal productivity but also robustness against environmental perturbations. Engineering an organism towards an increased production flux, however, often compromises that robustness. In this contribution, we review and investigate how various analytical approaches used in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are related to concepts developed by systems and control engineering. While trade-offs between production optimality and cellular robustness have already been studied diagnostically and statically, the dynamics also matter. Integration of the dynamic design aspects of control engineering with the more diagnostic aspects of metabolic, hierarchical control and regulation analysis is leading to the new, conceptual and operational framework required for the design of robust and productive dynamic pathways. 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract = {Dispersal biology at an invasion front differs from that of populations within the range core, because novel evolutionary and ecological processes come into play in the nonequilibrium conditions at expanding range edges. In a world where species' range limits are changing rapidly, we need to understand how individuals disperse at an invasion front. We analyzed an extensive dataset from radio-tracking invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) over the first 8 y since they arrived at a site in tropical Australia. Movement patterns of toads in the invasion vanguard differed from those of individuals in the same area postcolonization. Our model discriminated encamped versus dispersive phases within each toad's movements and demonstrated that pioneer toads spent longer periods in dispersive mode and displayed longer, more directed movements while they were in dispersive mode. These analyses predict that overall displacement per year is more than twice as far for toads at the invasion front compared with those tracked a few years later at the same site. Studies on established populations (or even those a few years postestablishment) thus may massively underestimate dispersal rates at the leading edge of an expanding population. This, in turn, will cause us to underpredict the rates at which invasive organisms move into new territory and at which native taxa can expand into newly available habitat under climate change.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a type of cell–cell communication using signal molecules that are released and detected by cells, which respond to changes in their population density.Quorum sensing (QS) is a type of cell–cell communication using signal molecules that are released and detected by cells, which respond to changes in their population density. A few studies explain that QS may operate in a density-dependent manner; however, due to experimental challenges, this fundamental hypothesis has never been investigated. Here, we present a microfluidic static droplet array (SDA) that combines a droplet generator with hydrodynamic traps to independently generate a bacterial population gradient into a parallel series of droplets under complete chemical and physical isolation. The SDA independently manipulates both a chemical concentration gradient and a bacterial population density. In addition, the bacterial population gradient in the SDA can be tuned by a simple change in the number of sample plug loading. Finally, the method allows the direct analysis of complicated biological events in an addressable droplet to enable the characterization of bacterial communication in response to the ratio of two microbial populations, including two genetically engineered QS circuits, such as the signal sender for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production and the signal receiver bacteria for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression induced by AHL. For the first time, we found that the population ratio of the signal sender and receiver indicates a significant and potentially interesting partnership between microbial communities. Therefore, we envision that this simple SDA could be a useful platform in various research fields, including analytical chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, synthetic biology, microbiology, and molecular biology.},

abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by the joint effect of (i) the global physiological state of the cell, in particular the activity of the gene expression machinery, and (ii) DNA-binding transcription factors and other specific regulators. We present a model-based approach to distinguish between these two effects using time-resolved measurements of promoter activities. We demonstrate the strength of the approach by analyzing a circuit involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in E. coli. Our results show that the transcriptional response of the network is controlled by the physiological state of the cell and the signaling metabolite cyclic AMP (cAMP). The absence of a strong regulatory effect of transcription factors suggests that they are not the main coordinators of gene expression changes during growth transitions, but rather that they complement the effect of global physiological control mechanisms. This change of perspective has important consequences for the interpretation of transcriptome data and the design of biological networks in biotechnology and synthetic biology. {\textcopyright} 2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Despite thorough mechanistic and structural information for some Acr proteins, how they are deployed and utilized by a phage during infection is unknown. Here, we show that Acr production does not guarantee phage replication, but instead, infections fail when phage population numbers fall below a critical threshold. Failing infections can be rescued by related phages that act as Acr donors, demonstrating that infections succeed if a sufficient Acr dose is contributed to a single cell by multiple phage genomes. The production of Acr proteins by phage genomes that fail to replicate leave the cell immunosuppressed, which predisposes the cell for successful infection by other phages in the population. This cooperative phage mechanism for CRISPR-Cas inhibition demonstrates inter-virus cooperation that may also manifest in other host-parasite interactions.},

abstract = {Cells rely on the precise action of proteins that detect and repair DNA damage. However, gene expression noise causes fluctuations in protein abundances that may compromise repair. For the Ada protein in Escherichia coli, which induces its own expression upon repairing DNA alkylation damage, we found that undamaged cells on average produce one Ada molecule per generation. Because production is stochastic, many cells have no Ada molecules and cannot induce the damage response until the first expression event occurs, which sometimes delays the response for generations. This creates a subpopulation of cells with increased mutation rates. Nongenetic variation in protein abundances thus leads to genetic heterogeneity in the population. Our results further suggest that cells balance reliable repair against toxic side effects of abundant DNA repair proteins.},

Here, we engineered signal-dependent motility in Escherichia coli via the transcriptional control of a key motility gene. Without manipulating chemotaxis, signal-dependent switching of motility, either on or off, led to population-level directional movement of cells up or down a signal gradient. We developed a mathematical model that captures the behaviour of the cells, enables identification of key parameters controlling system behaviour, and facilitates predictive-design of motility-based pattern formation. We demonstrated that motility of the receiver strains could be controlled by a sender strain generating a signal gradient. The modular quorum sensing-dependent architecture for interfacing different senders with receivers enabled a broad range of systems-level behaviours. The directional control of motility, especially combined with the potential to incorporate tuneable sensors and more complex sensing-logic, may lead to tools for novel biosensing and targeted-delivery applications.},

abstract = {Gene expression noise is a universal phenomenon across all life forms. Although beneficial under certain circumstances, expression noise is generally thought to be deleterious. However, neither the magnitude of the deleterious effect nor the primary mechanism of this effect is known. Here, we model the impact of expression noise on the fitness of unicellular organisms by considering the influence of suboptimal expressions of enzymes on the rate of biomass production and the energetic cost associated with imprecise amounts of protein synthesis. Our theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of yeast data show four findings. (i) Expression noise reduces the mean fitness of a cell by at least 25{\%}, and this reduction cannot be substantially alleviated by gene overexpression. (ii) Higher sensitivity of fitness to the expression fluctuations of essential genes than nonessential genes creates stronger selection against noise in essential genes, resulting in a decrease in their noise. (iii) Reduction of expression noise by genome doubling offers a substantial fitness advantage to diploids over haploids, even in the absence of sex. (iv) Expression noise generates fitness variation among isogenic cells, which lowers the efficacy of natural selection similar to the effect of population shrinkage. Thus, expression noise renders organisms both less adapted and less adaptable. Because expression noise is only one of many manifestations of the stochasticity in cellular molecular processes, our results suggest a much more fundamental role of molecular stochasticity in evolution than is currently appreciated.},

abstract = {The expression of genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. Thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that RNA polymerase (RNAP) is bound to the promoter of interest. Statistical mechanics provides a framework for computing these probabilities. Within this framework, interactions of activators, repressors, helper molecules and RNAP are described by a single function, the 'regulation factor'. This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest as a function of the number of regulatory proteins in the cell. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology have led to the development of many high-resolution methodologies that observe genomic activity and gene expression. This unit describes such an approach, native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), which reveals the density of RNA polymerase across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome with single-nucleotide resolution. A procedure for capturing nascent RNA transcripts directly from live cells through their association with the DNA-RNA-RNAP ternary complex is described. A protocol to create DNA libraries from the nascent RNA, allowing the identity and abundance of the 3' end of purified transcripts to be revealed by next generation sequencing, is also provided. By deep sequencing this DNA library, a quantitative measure of RNAP density with single-nucleotide precision is obtained. The quantitative nature of the NET-seq dataset relies on the high efficiency of many steps in the protocol. The steps that are most critical are described with suggestions for monitoring their success.},

We show that the combination of a synthetic modular genetic system with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy allows us to directly measure in real time the activity of any specific promoter in prokaryotes. Using a simple inducible gene expression system, we found that induced RNA levels within a single bacterium of Escherichia coli exhibited a pulsating profile in response to a steady input of inducer. The genetic deletion of an efflux pump system, a key determinant of antibiotic resistance, altered the pulsating transcriptional dynamics and caused overexpression of induced RNA. In contrast with population measurements, real-time RNA profiling permits identifying relationships between genotypes and transcriptional dynamics that are accessible only at the level of the single cell. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Expression control in synthetic genetic circuitry, for example, for construction of sensitive biosensors, is hampered by the lack of DNA parts that maintain ultralow background yet achieve high output upon signal integration by the cells. Here, we demonstrate how placement of auxiliary transcription factor binding sites within a regulatable promoter context can yield an important gain in signal-to-noise output ratios from prokaryotic biosensor circuits. As a proof of principle, we use the arsenite-responsive ArsR repressor protein from Escherichia coli and its cognate operator. Additional ArsR operators placed downstream of its target promoter can act as a transcription roadblock in a distance-dependent manner and reduce background expression of downstream-placed reporter genes. We show that the transcription roadblock functions both in cognate and heterologous promoter contexts. Secondary ArsR operators placed upstream of their promoter can also improve signal-to-noise output while maintaining effector dependency. Importantly, background control can be released through the addition of micromolar concentrations of arsenite. The ArsR-operator system thus provides a flexible system for additional gene expression control, which, given the extreme sensitivity to micrograms per liter effector concentrations, could be applicable in more general contexts.},

We formalize this task as a classification problem with sequential measurements, where the unknown function is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We propose LSE, an algorithm that guides both sampling and classification based on GP-derived confidence bounds, and provide theoretical guarantees about its sample complexity. Furthermore, we extend LSE and its theory to two more natural settings: (1) where the threshold level is implicitly defined as a percentage of the (unknown) maximum of the target function and (2) where samples are selected in batches. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on two problems of practical interest, namely autonomous monitoring of algal populations in a lake environment and geolocating network latency.},

abstract = {Transcription of highly expressed genes has been shown to occur in stochastic bursts. But the origin of such ubiquitous phenomenon has not been understood. Here, we present the mechanism in bacteria. We developed a high-throughput, in vitro, single-molecule assay to follow transcription on individual DNA templates in real time. We showed that positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment by transcription slows down transcription elongation and eventually stops transcription initiation. Transcription can be resumed upon gyrase binding to the DNA segment. Furthermore, using single-cell mRNA counting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that duty cycles of transcriptional bursting depend on the intracellular gyrase concentration. Together, these findings prove that transcriptional bursting of highly expressed genes in bacteria is primarily caused by reversible gyrase dissociation from and rebinding to a DNA segment, changing the supercoiling level of the segment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Experimental elucidation of the metabolic load placed on bacteria by the expression of foreign protein is presented. The host/vector system is Escherichia coli RR1/pBR329 (ampr, camr, and letr). Plasmid content results, which indicate that the plasmid copy number monotonically increases with decreasing growth rate, are consistent with the literature on ColE1‐like plasmids. More significantly, we have experimentally quantified the reduction in growth rate brought about by the expression of chloramphenicol‐acetyl‐transferase (CAT) and $\beta$‐lactamase. Results indicate a nearly linear decrease in growth rate with increasing foreign protein content. Also, the change in growth rate due to foreign protein expression depends on the growth rate of the cells. The observed linear relationship is media independent and, to our knowledge, previously undocumented. Furthermore, the induction of CAT, mediated by the presence of chloramphenicol, is shown to occur only at low growth rates, which further increases the metabolic load. Results are vdelineated with the aid of a structured kinetic model representing the metabolism of recombinant E. coli. In this article, several previous hypotheses and model predictions are justified and validated. This work provides an important step in the development of comprehensive, methabolically‐structured, kinetic models capable of prediciting optimal conditions for maximizing product yield.

abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) are bacteria associated with extraintestinal diseases in poultry. A method to generate markerless deletions of APEC genome is described. Lambda Red recombination is used to introduce a LoxP cassette (loxP-rpsL-neo-loxP) containing the rpsL gene for streptomycin sensitivity and the neo gene for kanamycin/neomycin resistance into the APEC genome, with attendant deletion of a desired chromosomal gene. The loxP sites are incorporated into primers used to amplify the rpsL-neo marker during the construction of the LoxP cassette, making the method rapid and efficient. The cassette is specifically integrated into the fiu gene or intergenic region 2051-52, and the Cre/lox system is used to remove the marker, hence deletion of the drug-resistance genes. The results demonstrate that the Cre/lox system can successfully be used to generate markerless deletions in APEC, and rpsL counter-selection can be used to select the deletions so that one does not have to pick and test to find the desired product.},

abstract = {Orientation with respect to gravity is essential for the survival of complex organisms. The gravity receptor is one of the phylogenetically oldest sensory systems, and special adaptations that enhance sensitivity to gravity are highly conserved. The fish inner ear contains three large extracellular biomineral particles, otoliths, which have evolved to transduce the force of gravity into neuronal signals. Mammalian ears contain thousands of small particles called otoconia that serve a similar function. Loss or displacement of these structures can be lethal for fish and is responsible for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in humans. The distinct morphologies of otoconial particles and otoliths suggest divergent developmental mechanisms. Mutations in a novel gene Otopetrin 1 (Otop1), encoding multi-transmembrane domain protein, result in nonsyndromic otoconial agenesis and a severe balance disorder in mice. Here we show that the zebrafish, Danio rerio, contains a highly conserved gene, otop1, that is essential for otolith formation. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of zebrafish Otop1 leads to otolith agenesis without affecting the sensory epithelium or other structures within the inner ear. Despite lack of otoliths in early development, otolith formation partially recovers in some fish after 2 days. However, the otoliths are malformed, misplaced, lack an organic matrix, and often consist of inorganic calcite crystals. These studies demonstrate that Otop1 has an essential and conserved role in the timing of formation and the size and shape of the developing otolith. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We applied the method to 3 Synechocystis single cells at 24 h and 3 single cells at 72 h after nitrogen-starvation stress treatment, as well as their bulk-cell controls under the same conditions, to determine the heterogeneity upon environmental stress. With 82-98{\%} and 31-48{\%} of all putative Synechocystis genes identified in single cells of 24 and 72 h, respectively, the results demonstrated that the method could achieve good identification of the transcripts in single bacterial cells. In addition, the preliminary results from nitrogen-starved cells also showed a possible increasing gene-expression heterogeneity from 24 h to 72 h after nitrogen starvation stress. Moreover, preliminary analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets revealed that genes from the "Mobile elements" functional category have the most significant increase of gene-expression heterogeneity upon stress, which was further confirmed by single-cell RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression in 24 randomly selected cells.},

abstract = {Riboswitches that sense S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are widely distributed throughout a variety of bacterial lineages. Four classes of SAM-binding riboswitches have been reported to date, constituting the most diverse collection of riboswitch classes that sense the same compound. Three of these classes, termed SAM-I, SAM-II, and SAM-III represent unique structures that form distinct binding pockets for the ligand. SAM-IV riboswitches carry different conserved sequence and structural features compared to other SAM riboswitches, but nucleotides and substructures corresponding to the ligand binding pocket are identical to SAM-I aptamers. In this article, we describe a fifth class of SAM binding aptamer, which we have termed SAM-V. SAM-V was discovered by analyzing GC-rich intergenic regions preceding metabolic genes in the marine alpha-proteobacterium "Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique." Although the motif is nearly unrepresented in cultured bacteria whose genomes have been completely sequenced, SAM-V is prevalent in marine metagenomic sequences. The consensus sequence and structure of SAM-V show some similarities to that of the SAM-II riboswitch, and it is likely that the two aptamers form similar ligand binding pockets. In addition, we identified numerous examples of a tandem SAM-II/SAM-V aptamer architecture. In this arrangement, the SAM-II aptamer is always positioned 5' of the SAM-V aptamer and the SAM-II aptamer is followed by a predicted intrinsic transcription terminator stem. The SAM-V aptamer, however, appears to use a ribosome binding site occlusion mechanism for genetic regulation. This tandem riboswitch arrangement exhibits an architecture that can potentially control both the transcriptional and translational stages of gene expression.},

abstract = {The behavior of genetic circuits is often poorly predictable. A gene's expression level is not only determined by the intended regulators, but also affected by changes in ribosome availability imparted by expression of other genes. Here we design a quasi-integral biomolecular feedback controller that enables the expression level of any gene of interest (GOI) to adapt to changes in available ribosomes. The feedback is implemented through a synthetic small RNA (sRNA) that silences the GOI's mRNA, and uses orthogonal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor to sense the GOI's translation and to actuate sRNA transcription. Without the controller, the expression level of the GOI is reduced by 50{\%} when a resource competitor is activated. With the controller, by contrast, gene expression level is practically unaffected by the competitor. This feedback controller allows adaptation of genetic modules to variable ribosome demand and thus aids modular construction of complicated circuits.},

abstract = {Bacteria use small molecule signals to communicate with each other. Intercellular signalling at high population cell densities is termed quorum sensing and explains many aspects of bacterial physiology observed in single species cultures entering stationary phase in the laboratory. Quorum sensing is used by diverse species to control a multitude of phenotypic traits that often include virulence factors (e.g., exoenzymes) and secondary metabolites (e.g., antibiotics and biosurfactants). In this review, diversity in the biochemistry and molecular biology of signal production, signal sensing, and signal response are introduced. The elucidation of the roles of quorum sensing in bacterial virulence and in biofilm formation will be used to illustrate experimental approaches commonly used. The understanding of quorum sensing obtained in vitro will be considered in the light of studies describing the activities of bacteria in the real situations of infection and biofilm formation. The relevance of quorum sensing to the activities of bacteria in real situations is discussed, taking into account the role of (1) other bacterial species; (2) the host; and (3) changes in other, nonsignalling, parameters within the environment.},

abstract = {In recent times, stochastic treatments of gene regulatory processes have appeared in the literature in which a cell exposed to a signaling molecule in its environment triggers the synthesis of a specific protein through a network of intracellular reactions. The stochastic nature of this process leads to a distribution of protein levels in a population of cells as determined by a Fokker-Planck equation. Often instability occurs as a consequence of two (stable) steady state protein levels, one at the low end representing the "off" state, and the other at the high end representing the "on" state for a given concentration of the signaling molecule within a suitable range. A consequence of such bistability has been the appearance of bimodal distributions indicating two different populations, one in the "off" state and the other in the "on" state. The bimodal distribution can come about from stochastic analysis of a single cell. However, the concerted action of the population altering the extracellular concentration in the environment of individual cells and hence their behavior can only be accomplished by an appropriate population balance model which accounts for the reciprocal effects of interaction between the population and its environment. In this study, we show how to formulate a population balance model in which stochastic gene expression in individual cells is incorporated. Interestingly, the simulation of the model shows that bistability is neither sufficient nor necessary for bimodal distributions in a population. The original notion of linking bistability with bimodal distribution from single cell stochastic model is therefore only a special consequence of a population balance model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Shu et al.},

abstract = {pRK212.2, a derivative of the broad host range plasmid RK2, contains two EcoRI cleavage fragments, A and B, neither of which can replicate by itself in Escherichia coli. Fragment A (41.7 kilobases), but not fragment B (14.4 kilobases), can be cloned by insertion into the unrelated plasmids mini-F and ColE1. Fragment B contains the origin of replication and the ampicillin-resistance determinant of RK2. Transformation of E. coli cells containing the mini-F-fragment A hybrid plasmid with fragment B DNA results in the recircularization and replication of fragment B as a nonmobilizable plasmid (pRK2067) with the copy number and incompatibility properties of RK2. Fragment B cannot be cloned in the absence of fragment A because the latter fragment suppresses a function, specified by fragment B, that results in loss of host cell viability. A small segment (2.4 kilobases) of fragment B that contains the RK2 origin of replication but no longer affects host cell growth in the absence of fragment A had been cloned previously by insertion into a ColE1 plasmid. This hybrid plasmid, designated pRK256, will replicate in E. coli polA mutants only when a fragment A-bearing helper plasmid is present. These results demonstrate that the potentially lethal function specified by fragment B of RK2 is not necessary for replication and that at least one trans-acting function is directly involved in RK2 replication.},

abstract = {Stochastic expression of genes produces heterogeneity in clonal populations of bacteria under identical conditions. We analyze and compare the behavior of the inducible lac genetic switch using well-stirred and spatially resolved simulations for Escherichia coli cells modeled under fast and slow-growth conditions. Our new kinetic model describing the switching of the lac operon from one phenotype to the other incorporates parameters obtained from recently published in vivo single-molecule fluorescence experiments along with in vitro rate constants. For the well-stirred system, investigation of the intrinsic noise in the circuit as a function of the inducer concentration and in the presence/absence of the feedback mechanism reveals that the noise peaks near the switching threshold. Applying maximum likelihood estimation, we show that the analytic two-state model of gene expression can be used to extract stochastic rates from the simulation data. The simulations also provide mRNA-protein probability landscapes, which demonstrate that switching is the result of crossing both mRNA and protein thresholds. Using cryoelectron tomography of an E. coli cell and data from proteomics studies, we construct spatial in vivo models of cells and quantify the noise contributions and effects on repressor rebinding due to cell structure and crowding in the cytoplasm. Compared to systems without spatial heterogeneity, the model for the fast-growth cells predicts a slight decrease in the overall noise and an increase in the repressors rebinding rate due to anomalous subdiffusion. The tomograms for E. coli grown under slow-growth conditions identify the positions of the ribosomes and the condensed nucleoid. The smaller slow-growth cells have increased mRNA localization and a larger internal inducer concentration, leading to a significant decrease in the lifetime of the repressor-operator complex and an increase in the frequency of transcriptional bursts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Roberts et al.},

Utilizing these elements, motile microbial colonies frequently develop complex patterns in response to adverse growth conditions on hard sur-faces under conditions of energy limitation. We employ the term morphotype to refer to specific properties of colonial development. The morphologies we discuss include a tip-splitting (T) morphotype, chiral (C) morphotype, and vortex (V) mor-photype. A generic modeling approach was developed by combining a detailed study of the cellular behavior and dynamics during colonial development and invoking concepts derived from the study of pattern formation in nonliving sys-tems. Analysis of patterning behavior of the models suggests bacterial processes whereby communication leads to self-organization by using cooperative cellular interactions. New features emerging from the model include various modes of cell-cell signaling, such as long-range chemorepulsion, short-range chemoattrac-tion, and, in the case of the V morphotype, rotational chemotaxis. In this regard, pattern formation in microorganisms can be viewed as the result of the exchange},

abstract = {Light-switchable proteins enable unparalleled control of molecular biological processes in live organisms. Previously, we have engineered red/far-red and green/red photoreversible two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) with transcriptional outputs in E. coli and used them to characterize and control synthetic gene circuits with exceptional quantitative, temporal, and spatial precision. However, the broad utility of these light sensors is limited by bulky DNA encoding, incompatibility with commonly used ligand-responsive transcription factors, leaky output in deactivating light, and less than 10-fold dynamic range. Here, we compress the four genes required for each TCS onto two streamlined plasmids and replace all chemically inducible and evolved promoters with constitutive, engineered versions. Additionally, we systematically optimize the expression of each sensor histidine kinase and response regulator, and redesign both pathway output promoters, resulting in low leakiness and 72- and 117-fold dynamic range, respectively. These second-generation light sensors can be used to program the expression of more genes over a wider range and can be more easily combined with additional plasmids or moved to different host strains. This work demonstrates that bacterial TCSs can be optimized to function as high-performance sensors for scientific and engineering applications.},

abstract = {Infection of Escherichia coli by the filamentous phage f1 is initiated by binding of the phage to the tip of the F conjugative pilus via the gene III protein. Subsequent translocation of phage DNA requires the chromosomally encoded TolQ, TolR, and TolA proteins, after the pilus presumably has withdrawn, bringing the phage to the bacterial surface. Of these three proteins, TolA is proposed to span the periplasm, since it contains a long helical domain (domain II), which connects a cytoplasmic membrane anchor domain (domain I) to the carboxyl-terminal domain (domain III). By using a transducing phage, the requirement for TolA in an F+ strain was found to be absolute. The role of TolA domains II and III in the infective process was examined by analyzing the ability of various deletion mutants of tolA to facilitate infection. The C-terminal domain III was shown to be essential, whereas the polyglycine region separating domains I and II could be deleted with no effect. Deletion of helical domain II reduced the efficiency of infection, which could be restored to normal by retaining the C-terminal half of domain II. Soluble domain III, expressed in the periplasm but not in the cytoplasm or in the medium, interfered with infection of a tolA+ strain. The essential interaction of TolA domain III with phage via gene III protein appears to require interaction with a third component, either the pilus tip or a periplasmic entity.},

We used lambda-Red recombination to precisely and efficiently position PCR-generated DNA targeting cassettes containing a fluorescent protein gene and an antibiotic resistance marker, at the C-termini of the CDSs of interest, creating in-frame fusions under the control of their native promoters. We incorporated cre/loxP and flpe/frt technology to enable multiple rounds of chromosomal tagging events to be performed sequentially with minimal disruption to the target locus, thus allowing sets of proteins to be co-localized within the cell. The visualization of labeled proteins in live E. coli cells using fluorescence microscopy revealed a striking variety of distributions including: membrane and nucleoid association, polar foci and diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Fifty of the fifty-two independent targeting experiments performed were successful, and 21 of the 23 selected CDSs could be fluorescently visualized. Our results show that E. coli has an organized and dynamic proteome, and demonstrate that this approach is applicable for tagging and (co-) localizing CDSs on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are regulatory RNA elements typically located in the 5'-untranslated region of certain mRNAs and control gene expression at the level of transcription or translation. These elements consist of a sensor and an adjacent actuator domain. The sensor usually is an aptamer that specifically interacts with a ligand. The actuator contains an intrinsic terminator or a ribosomal binding site for transcriptional or translational regulation, respectively. Ligand binding leads to structural rearrangements of the riboswitch and to presentation or masking of these regulatory elements. Based on this modular organization, riboswitches are an ideal target for constructing synthetic regulatory systems for gene expression. Although riboswitches for translational control have been designed successfully, attempts to construct synthetic elements regulating transcription have failed so far. Here, we present an in silico pipeline for the rational design of synthetic riboswitches that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level. Using the well-characterized theophylline aptamer as sensor, we designed the actuator part as RNA sequences that can fold into functional intrinsic terminator structures. In the biochemical characterization, several of the designed constructs show ligand-dependent control of gene expression in Escherichia coli, demonstrating that it is possible to engineer riboswitches not only for translational but also for transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {A key to advancing the understanding of molecular biology in the post-genomic age is the development of accurate predictive models for genetic regulation, protein interaction, metabolism, and other biochemical processes. To facilitate model development, simulation algorithms must provide an accurate representation of the system, while performing the simulation in a reasonable amount of time. Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) accurately depicts spatially homogeneous models with small populations of chemical species and properly represents noise, but it is often abandoned when modeling larger systems because of its computational complexity. In this work, we examine the performance of different versions of the SSA when applied to several biochemical models. Through our analysis, we discover that transient changes in reaction execution frequencies, which are typical of biochemical models with gene induction and repression, can dramatically affect simulator performance. To account for these shifts, we propose a new algorithm called the sorting direct method that maintains a loosely sorted order of the reactions as the simulation executes. Our measurements show that the sorting direct method performs favorably when compared to other well-known exact stochastic simulation algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Pattern formation is a hallmark of coordinated cell behaviour in both single and multicellular organisms. It typically involves cell-cell communication and intracellular signal processing. Here we show a synthetic multicellular system in which genetically engineered 'receiver' cells are programmed to form ring-like patterns of differentiation based on chemical gradients of an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal that is synthesized by 'sender' cells. In receiver cells, 'band-detect' gene networks respond to user-defined ranges of AHL concentrations. By fusing different fluorescent proteins as outputs of network variants, an initially undifferentiated 'lawn' of receivers is engineered to form a bullseye pattern around a sender colony. Other patterns, such as ellipses and clovers, are achieved by placing senders in different configurations. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal which kinetic parameters most significantly affect ring development over time. Construction and study of such synthetic multicellular systems can improve our quantitative understanding of naturally occurring developmental processes and may foster applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial fabrication and biosensing.},

abstract = {Recent studies of transcription have revealed a level of complexity not previously appreciated even a few years ago, both in the intricate use of post-initiation control and the mass production of rapidly degraded transcripts. Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

abstract = {Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the lac, ara and tet operon transcription control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in Escherichia coli of several gene activities independently and quantitatively. The novel promoter PLtetO-1 allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to 5000-fold range with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) whereas with IPTG and arabinose the activity of Plac/ara-1 may be controlled 1800-fold. Escherichia coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory proteins, Lac and Tet repressor as well as AraC from chromosomally located expression units provide highly reproducible in vivo conditions. Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products. The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of heterologous genes.},

It explores how people, including academics, students, industrialists and governance actors, tried to change their practices to bring engineering and biology together, and to realise such promises from within their everyday lives. It focuses on an ethnographic case study of an academic project that aimed to demonstrate the field's promise for solving water industry problems, from leaky pipes to climate change. In doing so, the book weaves together stories of barriers, bacteria and bodies, examining how they were entangled as people tried to make connections between academia and industry. It also reflects on the authors' attempts to work collaboratively with natural scientists and engineers, reflecting on current debates about the role of sociology in such interdisciplinary projects. The book contributes to contemporary studies of science and technology by highlighting issues such as ontology, practices, failure and time. {\textcopyright} Andrew S.

With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation.

abstract = {Gene drives have the potential to rapidly replace a harmful wild-type allele with a gene drive allele engineered to have desired functionalities. However, an accidental or premature release of a gene drive construct to the natural environment could damage an ecosystem irreversibly. Thus, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal consequences of the super-Mendelian population genetics prior to potential applications. Here, we employ a reaction-diffusion model for sexually reproducing diploid organisms to study how a locally introduced gene drive allele spreads to replace the wild-type allele, even though it possesses a selective disadvantage {\$}s{\textgreater}0{\$}. Using methods developed by N. Barton and collaborators, we show that socially responsible gene drives require {\$}0.5{\textless}s{\textless}0.697{\$}, a rather narrow range. In this "pushed wave" regime, the spatial spreading of gene drives will be initiated only when the initial frequency distribution is above a threshold profile called "critical propagule", which acts as a safeguard against accidental release. We also study how the spatial spread of the pushed wave can be stopped by making gene drives uniquely vulnerable ("sensitizing drive") in a way that is harmless for a wild-type allele. Finally, we show that appropriately sensitized drives in two dimensions can be stopped even by imperfect barriers perforated by a series of gaps.},

abstract = {Although single-cell RNA sequencing can reliably detect large-scale transcriptional programs, it is unclear whether it accurately captures the behavior of individual genes, especially those that express only in rare cells. Here, we use single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization as a gold standard to assess trade-offs in single-cell RNA-sequencing data for detecting rare cell expression variability. We quantified the gene expression distribution for 26 genes that range from ubiquitous to rarely expressed and found that the correspondence between estimates across platforms improved with both transcriptome coverage and increased number of cells analyzed. Further, by characterizing the trade-off between transcriptome coverage and number of cells analyzed, we show that when the number of genes required to answer a given biological question is small, then greater transcriptome coverage is more important than analyzing large numbers of cells. More generally, our report provides guidelines for selecting quality thresholds for single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments aimed at rare cell analyses. Single-cell RNA sequencing broadly assays the transcriptome of individual cells, but it is unclear what the trade-offs are when studying the behavior of individual genes.

abstract = {Gene expression involves inherently probabilistic steps that create fluctuations in protein abundances. The results from many in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such fluctuations arise and spread, often in ways consistent with stochastic models of transcription and translation. But fluctuations also arise during cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughters. Here we mathematically demonstrate how stochastic partitioning contributes to the non-genetic heterogeneity. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles are remarkably difficult to separate from gene expression noise. By applying these results to common experimental strategies and distinguishing between creation versus transmission of noise, we hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We propose experiments to separate between these two types of fluctuations and discuss future directions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we demonstrate that two transcripts, which were shown previously to be substrates for poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I), Escherichia coli lpp messenger RNA and bacteriophage $\lambda$ oop RNA, are polyadenylated more efficiently in slowly growing bacteria than in rapidly growing bacteria. Intracellular levels of PAP I varied in inverse proportion to bacterial growth rate. Moreover, transcription from a promoter for the pcnB gene (encoding PAP I) was shown to be more efficient under conditions of low bacterial growth rates. We conclude that efficiency of RNA polyadenylation in E. coli is higher in slowly growing bacteria because of more efficient expression of the pcnB gene. This may allow regulation of the stability of certain transcripts (those subjected to PAP I-dependent polyadenylation) in response to various growth conditions.},

abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc.},

The technique was first optimized by using the Phaeocystis lytic virus PpV-01. Then it was used to analyze natural samples from different oceanic locations. Virus samples were fixed with 0.5{\%} glutaraldehyde and deep frozen for delayed analysis. The samples were then diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer and analyzed in the presence of SYBR Green-I. A duplicate sample was heated at 80°C in the presence of detergent before analysis. Virus counts obtained by FCM were highly correlated to, although slightly higher than, those obtained by epifluorescence microscopy or by transmission electron microscopy (r ? 0.937, n ? 14, and r ? 0.96, n ? 8, respectively). Analysis of a depth profile from the Mediterranean Sea revealed that the abundance of viruses displayed the same vertical trend as that of planktonic cells. FCM permits us to distinguish between at least two and sometimes three virus populations in natural samples. Because of its speed and accuracy, FCM should prove very useful for studies of virus infection in cultures and should allow us to better understand the structure and dynamics of virus populations in natural waters.

abstract = {Collective behavior can spontaneously emerge when individuals follow common rules of interaction. However, the behavior of each individual differs due to existing genetic and non-genetic variation within the population. It remains unclear how this individuality is managed to achieve collective behavior. We quantify individuality in bands of clonal Escherichia coli cells that migrate collectively along a channel by following a self-generated gradient of attractant. We discover that despite substantial differences in individual chemotactic abilities, the cells are able to migrate as a coherent group by spontaneously sorting themselves within the moving band. This sorting mechanism ensures that differences between individual chemotactic abilities are compensated by differences in the local steepness of the traveling gradient each individual must navigate, and determines the minimum performance required to travel with the band. By resolving conflicts between individuality and collective migration, this mechanism enables populations to maintain advantageous diversity while on the move.},

abstract = {Several members of the two-component signal transduction family have been implicated in the control of polar development in Caulobacter crescentus: PleC and DivJ, two polarly localized histidine sensor kinases; and the response regulators DivK and PleD. The PleD protein was shown previously to be required during the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition for flagellar ejection and efficient stalk biogenesis. Here, we present data indicating that PleD also controls the onset of motility and a cell density switch immediately preceding cell division. Constitutively active alleles of pleD or wspR, an orthologue from Pseudomonas fluorescens, almost completely suppressed C. crescentus motility and inhibited the increase in swarmer cell density during cell differentiation. The observation that these alleles also had a dominant-negative effect on motility in a pleC divJ and a pleC divK mutant background indicated that PleD is located downstream of the other components in the signal transduction cascade, which controls the activity of the flagellar motor. In addition, the presence of a constitutive pleD or wspR allele resulted in a doubling of the average stalk length. Together, this is consistent with a model in which the active form of PleD, PleD approximately P, negatively controls aspects of differentiation in the late predivisional cell, whereas it acts positively on polar development during the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition. In agreement with such a model, we found that DivJ, which localizes to the stalked pole during cell differentiation, positively controlled the in vivo phosphorylation status of PleD, and the swarmer pole-specific PleC kinase modulated this status in a negative manner. Furthermore, domain switch experiments demonstrated that the WspR GGDEF output domain from P. fluorescens is active in C. crescentus, favouring a more general function for this novel signalling domain over a specific role such as DNA or protein interaction. Possible roles for PleD and its C-terminal output domain in modulating the polar cell surface of C. crescentus are discussed.},

Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter PR in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition experiments, and we discovered that cell size at replication initiation per origin, namely the initiation mass or unit cell, is remarkably invariant under perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication kinetics, fatty acid and cell wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape. Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in bacteria.},

abstract = {Elucidating the role of molecular stochasticity1 in cellular growth is central to understanding phenotypic heterogeneity2 and the stability of cellular proliferation3. The inherent stochasticity of metabolic reaction events4 should have negligible effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often considered to be constant for fixed conditions5,6. Stochastic fluctuations in the expression level1,7-9 of metabolic enzymes could produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However,whether suchmolecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear, given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms10-12, the slow adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes13,14, and the secretion15 and buffering16,17 of excess metabolites. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli, and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression oflac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely, growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression. Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other unrelated genes via growth.Homeostasis is promoted by a noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results indicate thatmolecular noise is propagatednot only by regulatory proteins18,19 but also by metabolic reactions. They also suggest that cellular metabolism is inherently stochastic, and a generic source of phenotypic heterogeneity.},

Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of VBNC cells requires the characterization of the clonal population with single-cell resolution. A combination of microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and fluorescent reporter strains offers the perfect platform for investigating individual cells while manipulating their environment. Here, we report a novel single-cell approach to investigate VBNC cells. We perform drug treatment, bacterial culturing, and live/dead staining in series by using transcriptional reporter strains and novel adaptations to the mother machine technology. Since we track each cell throughout the experiment, we are able to quantify the size, morphology and fluorescence that each VBNC cell displayed before, during and after drug treatment. We show that VBNC cells are not dead or dying cells but share similar phenotypic features with persister cells, suggesting a link between these two subpopulations, at least in the Escherichia coli strain under investigation. We strengthen this link by demonstrating that, before drug treatment, both persister and VBNC cells can be distinguished from the remainder of the population by their lower fluorescence when using a reporter strain for tnaC, encoding the leader peptide of the tnaCAB operon responsible for tryptophan metabolism. Our data demonstrates the suitability of our approach for studying the physiology of non-growing cells in response to external perturbations. Our approach will allow the identification of novel biomarkers for the isolation of VBNC and persister cells and will open new opportunities to map the detailed biochemical makeup of these clonal subpopulations.},

abstract = {Bacteria prudently regulate their metabolic phenotypes by sensing the availability of specific nutrients, expressing the required genes for their metabolism, and repressing them after specific metabolites are depleted. It is unclear, however, how genetic networks maintain and transmit phenotypic states between generations under rapidly fluctuating environments. By subjecting bacteria to fluctuating carbon sources (glucose and lactose) using microfluidics, we discover two types of non-genetic memory in Escherichia coli and analyze their benefits. First, phenotypic memory conferred by transmission of stable intracellular lac proteins dramatically reduces lag phases under cyclical fluctuations with intermediate timescales (1–10 generations). Second, response memory, a hysteretic behavior in which gene expression persists after removal of its external inducer, enhances adaptation when environments fluctuate over short timescales ({\textless}1 generation). Using a mathematical model we analyze the benefits of memory across environmental fluctuation timescales. We show that memory mechanisms provide an important class of survival strategies in biology that improve long-term fitness under fluctuating environments. These results can be used to understand how organisms adapt to fluctuating levels of nutrients, antibiotics, and other environmental stresses.},

However, conventional methods of measurement do not necessarily guarantee that this assumption is satisfied. In this study, we reveal a bi-plateau mode of gene expression at the single-cell level in bacterial batch cultures. The first plateau is dynamically active, where gene expression is at steady state; the second plateau, however, is dynamically inactive. We further demonstrate that the predictability of assembled genetic circuits in the first plateau (steady state) is much higher than that in the second plateau where conventional measurements are often performed. By taking the nature of steady state into consideration, our method of measurement promises to directly capture the intrinsic property of biological parts/circuits regardless of circuit-host or circuit-environment interactions.},

It is done either by encouraging cellular colonization of manufactured matrices or cellular recolonization of decellularized natural extracellular matrices from donor organs, or by allowing cells to self-organize into organs as they do during fetal life. For repair of normal bodies, this will be adequate but there are reasons for making unusual, non-evolved tissues (repair of unusual bodies, interface to electromechanical prostheses, incorporating living cells into life-support machines). Synthetic biology is aimed mainly at engineering cells so that they can perform custom functions: applying synthetic biological approaches to tissue engineering may be one way of engineering custom structures. In this article, we outline the 'embryological cycle' of patterning, differentiation and morphogenesis and review progress that has been made in constructing synthetic biological systems to reproduce these processes in new ways. The state-of-the-art remains a long way from making truly synthetic tissues, but there are now at least foundations for future work.},

A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events.

Identifying the sources of growth variation and their propagation across the cellular machinery can thus unravel mechanisms that underpin cell decisions. We present a stochastic cell model linking gene expression, metabolism and replication to predict growth dynamics in single bacterial cells. Alongside we provide a theory to analyse stochastic chemical reactions coupled with cell divisions, enabling efficient parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis and hypothesis testing. The cell model recovers population-averaged data on growth-dependence of bacterial physiology and how growth variations in single cells change across conditions. We identify processes responsible for this variation and reconstruct the propagation of initial fluctuations to growth and other processes. Finally, we study drug-nutrient interactions and find that antibiotics can both enhance and suppress growth heterogeneity. Our results provide a predictive framework to integrate heterogeneous data and draw testable predictions with implications for antibiotic tolerance, evolutionary and synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Quantitative modeling of gene circuits is fundamentally important to synthetic biology, as it offers the potential to transform circuit engineering from trial-and-error construction to rational design and, hence, facilitates the advance of the field. Currently, typical models regard gene circuits as isolated entities and focus only on the biochemical processes within the circuits. However, such a standard paradigm is getting challenged by increasing experimental evidence suggesting that circuits and their host are intimately connected, and their interactions can potentially impact circuit behaviors. Here we systematically examined the roles of circuit-host coupling in shaping circuit dynamics by using a self-activating gene switch as a model circuit. Through a combination of deterministic modeling, stochastic simulation, and Fokker-Planck equation formalism, we found that circuit-host coupling alters switch behaviors across multiple scales. At the single-cell level, it slows the switch dynamics in the high protein production regime and enlarges the difference between stable steady-state values. At the population level, it favors cells with low protein production through differential growth amplification. Together, the two-level coupling effects induce both quantitative and qualitative modulations of the switch, with the primary component of the effects determined by the circuit's architectural parameters. This study illustrates the complexity and importance of circuit-host coupling in modulating circuit behaviors, demonstrating the need for a new paradigm—integrated modeling of the circuit-host system—for quantitative understanding of engineered gene networks.},

abstract = {Movement over an agar surface via swarming motility is subject to formidable challenges not encountered during swimming. Bacteria display a great deal of flexibility in coping with these challenges, which include attracting water to the surface, overcoming frictional forces, and reducing surface tension. Bacteria that swarm on “hard” agar surfaces (robust swarmers) display a hyperflagellated and hyperelongated morphology. Bacteria requiring a “softer” agar surface (temperate swarmers) do not exhibit such a dramatic morphology. For polarly flagellated robust swarmers, there is good evidence that restriction of flagellar rotation somehow signals the induction of a large number of lateral flagella, but this scenario is apparently not relevant to temperate swarmers. Swarming bacteria can be further subdivided by their requirement for multiple stators (Mot proteins) or a stator-associated protein (FliL), secretion of essential polysaccharides, cell density-dependent gene regulation including surfactant synthesis, a functional chemotaxis signaling pathway, appropriate cyclic (c)-di-GMP levels, induction of virulence determinants, and various nutritional requirements such as iron limitation or nitrate availability. Swarming strategies are as diverse as the bacteria that utilize them. The strength of these numerous designs stems from the vantage point they offer for understanding mechanisms for effective colonization of surface niches, acquisition of pathogenic potential, and identification of environmental signals that regulate swarming. The signature swirling and streaming motion within a swarm is an interesting phenomenon in and of itself, an emergent behavior with properties similar to flocking behavior in diverse systems, including birds and fish, providing a convenient new avenue for modeling such behavior.},

Illumination of the resultant fusion kinase YF1 reduced net kinase activity by ∼ 1000-fold in vitro. YF1 also controls gene expression in a light-dependent manner in vivo. Signals are transmitted from the light-oxygen-voltage sensor domain to the histidine kinase domain via a 40°-60° rotational movement within an $\alpha$-helical coiled-coil linker; light is acting as a rotary switch. These signaling principles are broadly applicable to domains linked by $\alpha$-helices and to chemo- and photosensors. Conserved sequence motifs guide the rational design of light-regulated variants of histidine kinases and other proteins.},

abstract = {Bacteria adapt to environmental stress by producing proteins that provide stress protection. However, stress can severely perturb the kinetics of gene expression, disrupting protein production. Here, we characterized how Escherichia coli mitigates such perturbations under nutrient stress through the kinetic coordination of transcription and translation. We observed that, when translation became limiting under nitrogen starvation, transcription elongation slowed accordingly. This slowdown was mediated by (p)ppGpp, the alarmone whose primary role is thought to be promoter regulation. This kinetic coordination by (p)ppGpp was critical for the robust synthesis of gene products. Surprisingly, under carbon starvation, (p)ppGpp was dispensable for robust synthesis. Characterization of the underlying kinetics revealed that under carbon starvation, transcription became limiting, and translation aided transcription elongation. This mechanism naturally coordinated transcription with translation, alleviating the need for (p)ppGpp as a mediator. These contrasting mechanisms for coordination resulted in the condition-dependent effects of (p)ppGpp on global protein synthesis and starvation survival. Our findings reveal a kinetic aspect of gene expression plasticity, establishing (p)ppGpp as a condition-dependent global effector of gene expression.},

abstract = {Genetically encoded fluorescent ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have diverse applications, including imaging RNA trafficking and as a component of RNA-based sensors that exhibit fluorescence upon binding small molecules in live cells. These RNAs include the Spinach and Spinach2 aptamers, which bind and activate the fluorescence of fluorophores similar to that found in green fluorescent protein. Although additional highly fluorescent RNA-fluorophore complexes would extend the utility of this technology, the identification of novel RNA-fluorophore complexes is difficult. Current approaches select aptamers on the basis of their ability to bind fluorophores, even though fluorophore binding alone is not sufficient to activate fluorescence. Additionally, aptamers require extensive mutagenesis to efficiently fold and exhibit fluorescence in living cells. Here we describe a platform for rapid generation of highly fluorescent RNA-fluorophore complexes that are optimized for function in cells. This procedure involves selection of aptamers on the basis of their binding to fluorophores, coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of millions of aptamers expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising aptamers are then further optimized using a FACS-based directed evolution approach. Using this approach, we identified several novel aptamers, including a 49-nt aptamer, Broccoli. Broccoli binds and activates the fluorescence of (Z)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one. Broccoli shows robust folding and green fluorescence in cells, and increased fluorescence relative to Spinach2. This reflects, in part, improved folding in the presence of low cytosolic magnesium concentrations. Thus, this novel fluorescence-based selection approach simplifies the generation of aptamers that are optimized for expression and performance in living cells.},

This rendered the Gfp susceptible to the action of indigenous housekeeping proteases, resulting in protein variants with half-lives ranging from 40 min to a few hours when synthesized in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida.

abstract = {We present a generic mechanism by which reproducing microorganisms, with a diffusivity that depends on the local population density, can form stable patterns. For instance, it is known that a decrease of bacterial motility with density can promote separation into bulk phases of two coexisting densities; this is opposed by the logistic law for birth and death that allows only a single uniform density to be stable. The result of this contest is an arrested nonequilibrium phase separation in which dense droplets or rings become separated by less dense regions, with a characteristic steady-state length scale. Cell division predominates in the dilute regions and cell death in the dense ones, with a continuous flux between these sustained by the diffusivity gradient. We formulate a mathematical model of this in a case involving run-and-tumble bacteria and make connections with a wider class of mechanisms for density-dependent motility. No chemotaxis is assumed in the model, yet it predicts the formation of patterns strikingly similar to some of those believed to result from chemotactic behavior.},

abstract = {The rdar morphotype, a multicellular behaviour of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli is characterized by the expression of the adhesive extracellular matrix components cellulose and curli fimbriae. The response regulator CsgD, which transcriptionally activates the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide cellulose and curli, also transforms cell physiology to the multicellular state. However, the only role of CsgD in cellulose biosynthesis is the activation of AdrA, a GGDEF domain protein that mediates production of the allosteric activator cyclic-di-(3'-5')guanylic acid (c-di-GMP). In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium a regulatory network consisting of 19 GGDEF/EAL domain-containing proteins tightly controls the concentration of c-di-GMP. c-di-GMP not only regulates the expression of cellulose, but also stimulates expression of adhesive curli and represses various modes of motility. Functions of characterized GGDEF and EAL domain proteins, as well as database searches, point to a global role for c-di-GMP as a novel secondary messenger that regulates a variety of cellular functions in response to diverse environmental stimuli already in the deepest roots of the prokaryotes.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are gene-regulating RNAs that are usually found in the 5'-untranslated regions of messenger RNA. As the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA is highly negatively charged, the folding and ligand-binding interactions of riboswitches are strongly dependent on the presence of cations. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and hydroxyl radical footprinting, we examined the cation dependence of the different folding stages of the glycine-binding riboswitch from Vibrio cholerae. We found that the partial folding of the tandem aptamer of this riboswitch in the absence of glycine is supported by all tested mono- and divalent ions, suggesting that this transition is mediated by nonspecific electrostatic screening. Poisson-Boltzmann calculations using SAXS-derived low-resolution structural models allowed us to perform an energetic dissection of this process. The results showed that a model with a constant favorable contribution to folding that is opposed by an unfavorable electrostatic term that varies with ion concentration and valency provides a reasonable quantitative description of the observed folding behavior. Glycine binding, on the other hand, requires specific divalent ions binding based on the observation that Mg(2+), Ca(2+), and Mn(2+) facilitated glycine binding, whereas other divalent cations did not. The results provide a case study of how ion-dependent electrostatic relaxation, specific ion binding, and ligand binding can be coupled to shape the energetic landscape of a riboswitch and can begin to be quantitatively dissected.},

abstract = {A cell in vivo is part of a large, networked community. An individual cell's fate is strongly influenced by its interactions with neighbouring cells. While this interaction has been recognized as critical in determining cell behaviour, its complexity and heterogeneity has thus far defied characterization by currently available techniques. Herein, we present a single-cell level co-culture platform for studies of dynamic cellular interactions, which is capable of maintaining and tracking single-cell pair interactions to simplify the complexity of intercellular communication. In this platform, heterotypic pairing on a single-cell level is achieved through sequential cell trapping and dynamic variation of fluidic resistance. Individual culture chambers provide trapped cells enough space to migrate and proliferate through multiple generations. Furthermore, the semi-isolated chambers, combined with continuously refreshed medium supplement, allow a stable communication environment around the cells. To demonstrate the platform capability, we cultured and tracked stem cell-fibroblast pairs for several generations. The subsequent effects of cell–cell interactions were then easily observed, due to the addressability of each isolated chamber, and quantitatively characterized. Specifically, we found that paired cells' migration patterns were dependent on their initial distance from each other, and that heterotypic pairing led to distinct proliferation patterns from homotypic, single-cell culture. This study demonstrates the platform utility in providing a detailed and quantitative understanding of the complexity of cellular communication and its effects on cell behaviour in a variety of biological systems.},

In this paper, a novel batch Bayesian optimization approach is proposed. The parallelization is realized via a multi-objective ensemble of multiple acquisition functions. In each iteration, the multi-objective optimization of the multiple acquisition functions is performed to search for the Pareto front of the acquisition functions. The batch of inputs are then selected from the Pareto front. The Pareto front represents the best trade-off between the multiple acquisition functions. Such a policy for batch Bayesian optimization can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art batch Bayesian optimization algorithms using analytical benchmark functions and real-world analog integrated circuits. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Prediction of the microbial growth rate as a response to changing temperatures is an important aspect in the control of food safety and food spoilage. Accurate model predictions of the microbial evolution ask for correct model structures and reliable parameter values with good statistical quality. Given the widely accepted validity of the Cardinal Temperature Model with Inflection (CTMI) [Rosso, L., Lobry, J. R., Bajard, S. and Flandrois, J. P., 1995. Convenient model to describe the combined effects of temperature and pH on microbial growth, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 61: 610-616], this paper focuses on the accurate estimation of its four parameters (Tmin, Topt, Tmaxand $\mu$opt) by applying the technique of optimal experiment design for parameter estimation (OED/PE). This secondary model describes the influence of temperature on the microbial specific growth rate from the minimum to the maximum temperature for growth. Dynamic temperature profiles are optimized within two temperature regions ([15 °C, 43 °C] and [15 °C, 45 °C]), focusing on the minimization of the parameter estimation (co)variance (D-optimal design). The optimal temperature profiles are implemented in a computer controlled bioreactor, and the CTMI parameters are identified from the resulting experimental data. Approximately equal CTMI parameter values were derived irrespective of the temperature region, except for Tmax. The latter could only be estimated accurately from the optimal experiments within [15 °C, 45 °C]. This observation underlines the importance of selecting the upper temperature constraint for OED/PE as close as possible to the true Tmax. Cardinal temperature estimates resulting from designs within [15 °C, 45 °C] correspond with values found in literature, are characterized by a small uncertainty error and yield a good result during validation. As compared to estimates from non-optimized dynamic experiments, more reliable CTMI parameter values were obtained from the optimal experiments within [15 °C, 45 °C]. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

Functionality of this package includes correction of motion artifacts occurring during in vivo imaging with laser-scanning microscopy, segmentation of imaged fields into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of signals from the segmented ROIs. We have also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for manual editing of the automatically segmented ROIs and automated registration of ROIs across multiple imaging datasets. This software has been designed with flexibility in mind to allow for future extension with different analysis methods and potential integration with other packages.

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is often the result of mutations that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then mutate to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these mutations result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher acrAB expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene mutS, lower growth rates, and higher mutation frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated acrAB expression can promote spontaneous mutations within single cells.},

Gene synthesis often provides a fast and economically efficient approach. The synthetic gene can be optimized for expression and constructed for easy mutational manipulation without regard to the parent genome. Yet design and construction of synthetic genes, especially those coding for large proteins, can be a slow, difficult and confusing process. We have written a computer program that automates the design of oligonucleotides for gene synthesis. Our program requires simple input information, i.e. amino acid sequence of the target protein and melting temperature (needed for the gene assembly) of synthetic oligonucleotides. The program outputs a series of oligonucleotide sequences with codons optimized for expression in an organism of choice. Those oligonucleotides are characterized by highly homogeneous melting temperatures and a minimized tendency for hairpin formation. With the help of this program and a two-step PCR method, we have successfully constructed numerous synthetic genes, ranging from 139 to 1042 bp. The approach presented here simplifies the production of proteins from a wide variety of organisms for genomics-based studies.},

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9 technology provides a powerful system for genome engineering. However, variable activity across different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) remains a significant limitation. We analyzed the molecular features that influence sgRNA stability, activity and loading into Cas9 in vivo. We observed that guanine enrichment and adenine depletion increased sgRNA stability and activity, whereas differential sgRNA loading, nucleosome positioning and Cas9 off-target binding were not major determinants. We also identified sgRNAs truncated by one or two nucleotides and containing 5' mismatches as efficient alternatives to canonical sgRNAs. On the basis of these results, we created a predictive sgRNA-scoring algorithm, CRISPRscan, that effectively captures the sequence features affecting the activity of CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo. Finally, we show that targeting Cas9 to the germ line using a Cas9-nanos 3' UTR led to the generation of maternal-zygotic mutants, as well as increased viability and decreased somatic mutations. These results identify determinants that influence Cas9 activity and provide a framework for the design of highly efficient sgRNAs for genome targeting in vivo.},

From the steady-state density-profile of bacteria with one dominant thermo-sensor, Tar or Tsr, we deduce the response function of each receptor to temperature changes. Using the response functions of both receptors, we determine the relationship between the favored temperature of wild-type bacteria with mixed clusters of receptors and the receptor ratio. Our model is based on the assumption that the behavior of a wild-type bacterium in a temperature gradient is determined by a linear combination of the independent responses of the two receptors, factored by the receptor's relative abundance in the bacterium. This is confirmed by comparing our model predictions with measurements of the steady-state density-profile of several bacterial populations in a temperature gradient. Our results reveal that the density-profile of wild-type bacteria can be accurately described by measuring the distribution of the ratio Tar/Tsr in the population, which is then used to divide the population into groups with distinct Tar/Tsr values, whose behavior can be described in terms of independent Gaussian distributions. Each of these Gaussians is centered about the favored temperature of the subpopulation, which is determined by the receptor ratio, and has a width defined by the temperature-dependent speed and persistence time.},

abstract = {Bacteria growing under different conditions experience a broad range of demand on the rate of protein synthesis, which profoundly affects cellular resource allocation. During fast growth, protein synthesis has long been known to be modulated by adjusting the ribosome content, with the vast majority of ribosomes engaged at a near-maximal rate of elongation. Here, we systematically characterize protein synthesis by Escherichia coli, focusing on slow-growth conditions. We establish that the translational elongation rate decreases as growth slows, exhibiting a Michaelis-Menten dependence on the abundance of the cellular translational apparatus. However, an appreciable elongation rate is maintained even towards zero growth, including the stationary phase. This maintenance, critical for timely protein synthesis in harsh environments, is accompanied by a drastic reduction in the fraction of active ribosomes. Interestingly, well-known antibiotics such as chloramphenicol also cause a substantial reduction in the pool of active ribosomes, instead of slowing down translational elongation as commonly thought.},

The operators of a subset were determined using an in vitro method, and this information was used to build synthetic promoters. The promoters and repressors were screened for cross-reactions. Of these, 16 were identified that both strongly repress their cognate promoter (5- to 207-fold) and exhibit minimal interactions with other promoters. Each repressor-promoter pair was converted to a NOT gate and characterized. Used as a set of 16 NOT/NOR gates, there are {\textgreater}10(54) circuits that could be built by changing the pattern of input and output promoters.

abstract = {Phenotypic diversification of cells is crucial for developmental and regenerative processes in multicellular organisms. The diversification concept is described as the motion of marbles rolling down Waddington's landscape, in which the number of stable states changes as development proceeds. In contrast to this simple concept, the complexity of natural biomolecular processes prevents comprehension of their design principles. We have constructed, in Escherichia coli, a synthetic circuit with just four genes, which programs cells to autonomously diversify as the motion on the landscape through cell-cell communication. The circuit design was based on the combination of a bistable toggle switch with an intercellular signaling system. The cells with the circuit diversified into two distinct cell states, "high" and "low," in vivo and in silico, when all of the cells started from the low state. The synthetic diversification was affected by not only the shape of the landscape determined by the circuit design, which includes the synthesis rate of the signaling molecule, but also the number of cells in the experiments. This cell-number dependency is reminiscent of the "community effect": The fates of developing cells are determined by their number. Our synthetic circuit could be a model system for studying diversification and differentiation in higher organisms. Prospectively, further integrations of our circuit with different cellular functions will provide unique tools for directing cell fates on the population level in tissue engineering.},

It is efficient and can be used when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point. However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies, the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on the algorithm's performance.},

@article{Haldimann2001a,
abstract = {We have developed a series of powerful and versatile conditional-replication, integration, and modular (CRIM) plasmids. CRIM plasmids can be replicated at medium or high copy numbers in different hosts for making gene (or mutant) libraries. They can be integrated in single copies into the chromosomes of Escherichia coli and related bacteria to study gene function under normal physiological conditions. They can be excised from the chromosome, e.g., to verify that phenotypes are caused by their presence. Furthermore, they can be retrieved singly or en masse for subsequent molecular analyses. CRIM plasmids are integrated into the chromosome by site-specific recombination at one of five different phage attachment sites. Integrants are selected as antibiotic-resistant transformations. Since CRIM plasmids encode different forms of resistance, several can be used together in the same cell for stable expression of complex metabolic or regulatory pathways from diverse sources. Following integration, integrants are stably maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection. Each CRIM plasmid has a polylinker or one of several promoters for ectopic expression of the inserted DNA. Their modular design allows easy construction of new variants with different combinations of features. We also report a series of easily curable, low-copy-number helper plasmids encoding all the requisite Int proteins alone or with the respective Xis protein. These helper plasmids facilitate integration, excision (" curing "), or retrieval of the CRIM plasmids. Multicopy plasmids have greatly facilitated gene structure-function studies. However, the use of such plasmids can lead to high-copy-number artifacts, especially in physiological studies. Thus, several methods have been developed for recombining genes on bacterial chromosomes in order to study their func-tions in single copies. Such methods are frequently used to construct novel Escherichia coli strains that stably express for-eign genes for use in both basic research and biotechnology (5, 18, 27). However, the development of strains encoding com-plex metabolic or regulatory pathways poses special problems that often require manipulating many genes and expressing them individually at different levels or under separate regula-tory controls. To address these concerns, we have developed a series of plasmid-host systems for the introduction of multiple genes into the same cell in single copies. Our approach is based on genome targeting systems that utilize plasmids carrying a conditional-replication origin and a phage attachment (attP) site (17). We refer to our plasmids as CRIM (conditional-replication, integration, and modular) plasmids. CRIM plas-mids can be integrated into or retrieved from their bacterial attachment (attB) site by supplying phage integrase (Int) with-out or with excisionase (Xis) in trans. Advantages of our CRIM plasmid-host systems include the use of alternative attP and attB sites (for phages ␭, HK022, ␾80, P21, and P22) and different selectable markers (for chlor-amphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, spectinomycin and strep-tomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim resistance) in conjunc-tion with a polylinker or promoter (P araB , P rhaB , P rhaS , P tac , P syn1 , and P syn4) for ectopic expression of the cloned gene(s). These CRIM plasmids have the ␥ replication origin of R6K, which requires the trans-acting ⌸ protein (encoded by pir) for replication. So, they replicate at a medium (15 per cell) or high (250 per cell) plasmid copy number in pir ϩ or pir-116 (high-copy-number mutant) E. coli hosts (28), respectively. Int helper plasmids are used for integration of CRIM plasmids into the corresponding chromosomal attB sites of normal (non-pir) hosts, which are nonpermissive for CRIM plasmid repli-cation. Xis/Int helper plasmids are used for excision (" curing ") of the respective CRIM plasmids from the chromosome, e.g., to verify that phenotypes are due to their presence. Xis/Int helper plasmids are also used for retrieval (cloning) of CRIM plasmids from the chromosome, e.g., to recover a particular CRIM plasmid after screening of CRIM plasmid or mutant libraries. Since integration and retrieval involve phage-site-specific recombination events, the original and recovered plasmids are identical. CRIM plasmids can therefore be used for the con-struction of gene (or mutant) libraries that can be directly integrated into bacterial chromosomes in single copies for screening or selection purposes. Afterwards, CRIM plasmids can be retrieved from individual cells or en masse. The recov-ered plasmids can then be propagated as plasmids for molec-ular analysis or integrated directly into the chromosomes of other hosts for subsequent processing without further in vitro manipulation steps. We previously found similar oriR ␥ att ␭ plasmids to be extremely useful in mutagenesis studies, espe-cially when it was important that the mutated gene be free of plasmid copy number effects (16). We also found them to be useful in studying genes from diverse bacteria, including},

abstract = {Riboswitches are complex folded RNA domains found in noncoding regions of mRNA that regulate gene expression upon small molecule binding. Recently, Breaker and coworkers reported a tandem aptamer riboswitch (VCI-II) that binds glycine cooperatively. Here, we use hydroxyl radical footprinting and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to study the conformations of this tandem aptamer as a function of Mg2+and glycine concentration. We fit a simple three-state thermodynamic model that describes the energetic coupling between magnesium-induced folding and glycine binding. Furthermore, we characterize the structural conformations of each of the three states: In low salt with no magnesium present, the VCI-II construct has an extended overall conformation, presumably representing unfolded structures. Addition of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+in the absence of glycine leads to a significant compaction and partial folding as judged by hydroxyl radical protections. In the presence of millimolar Mg2+concentrations, the tandem aptamer binds glycine cooperatively. The glycine binding transition involves a further compaction, additional tertiary packing interactions and further uptake of magnesium ions relative to the state in high Mg2+but no glycine. Employing density reconstruction algorithms, we obtain low resolution 3-D structures for all three states from the SAXS measurements. These data provide a first glimpse into the structural conformations of the VCI-II aptamer, establish rigorous constraints for further modeling, and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cells within a genetically identical population exhibit phenotypic variation that in some cases can persist across multiple generations. However, information about the temporal variation and familial dependence of protein levels remains hidden when studying the population as an ensemble. To correlate phenotypes with the age and genealogy of single cells over time, we developed a microfluidic device that enables us to track multiple lineages in parallel by trapping single cells and constraining them to grow in lines for as many as 8 divisions. To illustrate the utility of this method, we investigate lineages of cells expressing one of 3 naturally regulated proteins, each with a different representative expression behavior. Within lineages deriving from single cells, we observe genealogically related clusters of cells with similar phenotype; cluster sizes vary markedly among the 3 proteins, suggesting that the time scale of phenotypic persistence is protein-specific. Growing lines of cells also allows us to dynamically track temporal fluctuations in protein levels at the same time as pedigree relationships among the cells as they divide in the chambers. We observe bursts in expression levels of the heat shock protein Hsp12-GFP that occur simultaneously in mother and daughter cells. In contrast, the ribosomal protein Rps8b-GFP shows relatively constant levels of expression over time. This method is an essential step toward understanding the time scales of phenotypic variation and correlations in phenotype among single cells within a population.},

We employed nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) and mutagenesis to explore the chemical basis of glycine riboswitch cooperativity.

Mutation of these residues altered both the cooperativity and binding affinity of the riboswitch. The data support a model in which the P1 helix of the first aptamer participates in a tertiary interaction important for cooperativity, while nucleotides in the P1 helix of the second aptamer interface with the expression platform. These data have direct analogy to well-characterized mutations in hemoglobin, which provides a framework for considering cooperativity in this RNA-based system.},

abstract = {Optimizing conditions for the overexpression and purification of membrane proteins for functional and structural studies is usually a laborious and time-consuming process. This process can be accelerated using membrane protein–GFP fusions1–3, which allows direct monitoring and visualization of membrane proteins of interest at any stage during overexpression, solubilization and purification (Fig. 1). The exceptionally stable GFP moiety of the fusion protein can be used to detect membrane proteins by observing fluorescence in whole cells during overexpression, with a detection limit as low as 10 µg of GFP per liter of culture, and in solution during solubilization and purification. Notably, the fluorescence of the GFP moiety can also be detected in standard SDS polyacrylamide gels with a detection limit of less than 5 ng of GFP per protein band (Fig. 2). In-gel fluorescence allows assessment of the integrity of membrane protein–GFP fusions and provides a rapid and generic alternative for the notoriously difficult immunoblotting of membrane proteins. With whole-cell and in-gel fluorescence the overexpression potential of many membrane protein–GFP fusions can be rapidly assessed and yields of promising targets can be improved. In this protocol the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pET system—the most widely used (membrane) protein overexpression system—is used as a platform to illustrate the GFP-based method. The methodology described in this protocol can be transferred easily to other systems.},

@article{Sanamrad2014,
abstract = {Biochemical and genetic data show that ribosomes closely follow RNA polymerases that are transcribing protein-coding genes in bacteria. At the same time, electron and fluorescence microscopy have revealed that ribosomes are excluded from the Escherichia coli nucleoid, which seems to be inconsistent with fast translation initiation on nascent mRNA transcripts. The apparent paradox can be reconciled if translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid before they relocate to the periphery. However, this mechanism requires that free ribosomal subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. Here, we use single-particle tracking in living E. coli cells to determine the fractions of free ribosomal subunits, classify individual subunits as free or mRNA-bound, and quantify the degree of exclusion of bound and free subunits separately. We show that free subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. This finding strongly suggests that translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid, which reconciles the spatial separation of DNA and ribosomes with cotranscriptional translation. We also show that, after translation inhibition, free subunit precursors are partially excluded from the compacted nucleoid. This finding indicates that it is active translation that normally allows ribosomal subunits to assemble on nascent mRNAs throughout the nucleoid and that the effects of translation inhibitors are enhanced by the limited access of ribosomal subunits to nascent mRNAs in the compacted nucleoid.},

abstract = {Edge detection is a signal processing algorithm common in artificial intelligence and image recognition programs. We have constructed a genetically encoded edge detection algorithm that programs an isogenic community of E. coli to sense an image of light, communicate to identify the light-dark edges, and visually present the result of the computation. The algorithm is implemented using multiple genetic circuits. An engineered light sensor enables cells to distinguish between light and dark regions. In the dark, cells produce a diffusible chemical signal that diffuses into light regions. Genetic logic gates are used so that only cells that sense light and the diffusible signal produce a positive output. A mathematical model constructed from first principles and parameterized with experimental measurements of the component circuits predicts the performance of the complete program. Quantitatively accurate models will facilitate the engineering of more complex biological behaviors and inform bottom-up studies of natural genetic regulatory networks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Cellular processes are carried out by many genes, and their study and optimization requires multiple levers by which they can be independently controlled. The most common method is via a genetically encoded sensor that responds to a small molecule. However, these sensors are often suboptimal, exhibiting high background expression and low dynamic range. Further, using multiple sensors in one cell is limited by cross-talk and the taxing of cellular resources. Here, we have developed a directed evolution strategy to simultaneously select for lower background, high dynamic range, increased sensitivity, and low cross-talk. This is applied to generate a set of 12 high-performance sensors that exhibit {\textgreater}100-fold induction with low background and cross-reactivity. These are combined to build a single “sensor array” in the genomes of E. coli MG1655 (wild-type), DH10B (cloning), and BL21 (protein expression). These “Marionette” strains allow for the independent control of gene expression using 12 small-molecule inducers.},

abstract = {In recent years the State of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, has maintained a low tuberculosis incidence rate with little evidence of local transmission. Nearly 90{\%} of notified tuberculosis cases occurred in people born in tuberculosis-endemic countries. We analyzed geographic, epidemiological and genotypic data of all culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases to identify the bacterial and demographic determinants of tuberculosis hotspot areas in NSW. Standard 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-24) typing was performed on all isolates recovered between 2009 and 2013. In total 1692/1841 (91.9{\%}) cases with confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection had complete MIRU-24 and demographic data and were included in the study. Despite some year-to-year variability, spatio-temporal analysis identified four tuberculosis hotspots. The incidence rate and the relative risk of tuberculosis in these hotspots were 2- to 10-fold and 4- to 8-fold higher than the state average, respectively. MIRU-24 profiles of M. tuberculosis isolates associated with these hotspots revealed high levels of heterogeneity. This suggests that these spatio-temporal hotspots, within this low incidence setting, can represent areas of predominantly imported infection rather than clusters of cases due to local transmission. These findings provide important epidemiological insight and demonstrate the value of combining tuberculosis genotyping and spatiotemporal data to guide better-targeted public health interventions.},

abstract = {Individual microbial species are known to occupy distinct metabolic niches within multi-species communities. However, it has remained largely unclear whether metabolic specialization can similarly occur within a clonal bacterial population. More specifically, it is not clear what functions such specialization could provide and how specialization could be coordinated dynamically. Here, we show that exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations, including one population that produces acetate, and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin, a pH-neutral storage molecule. These subpopulations exhibit distinct growth rates and dynamic interconversion between states. Furthermore, acetate concentration influences the relative sizes of the different subpopulations. These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic, environmentally-sensitive state-switching.},

Recent discoveries show that they are opportunistic, avirulent plant symbionts, as well as being parasites of other fungi. At least some strains establish robust and long-lasting colonizations of root surfaces and penetrate into the epidermis and a few cells below this level. They produce or release a variety of compounds that induce localized or systemic resistance responses, and this explains their lack of pathogenicity to plants. These root-microorganism associations cause substantial changes to the plant proteome and metabolism. Plants are protected from numerous classes of plant pathogen by responses that are similar to systemic acquired resistance and rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance. Root colonization by Trichoderma spp. also frequently enhances root growth and development, crop productivity, resistance to abiotic stresses and the uptake and use of nutrients.},

Here we report the crystal structure, at 2.7 A resolution, of a c-di-GMP riboswitch aptamer from Vibrio cholerae bound to c-di-GMP, showing that the ligand binds within a three-helix junction that involves base-pairing and extensive base-stacking. The symmetric c-di-GMP is recognized asymmetrically with respect to both the bases and the backbone. A mutant aptamer was engineered that preferentially binds the candidate signaling molecule c-di-AMP over c-di-GMP. Kinetic and structural data suggest that genetic regulation by the c-di-GMP riboswitch is kinetically controlled and that gene expression is modulated through the stabilization of a previously unidentified P1 helix, illustrating a direct mechanism for c-di-GMP signaling.},

abstract = {Flagellated bacteria can swim within a thin film of fluid that coats a solid surface, such as agar; this is a means for colony expansion known as swarming. We found that micrometer-sized bubbles make excellent tracers for the motion of this fluid. The microbubbles form explosively when small aliquots of an aqueous suspension of droplets of a water-insoluble surfactant (Span 83) are placed on the agar ahead of a swarm, as the water is absorbed by the agar and the droplets are exposed to air. Using these bubbles, we discovered an extensive stream (or river) of swarm fluid flowing clockwise along the leading edge of an Escherichia coli swarm, at speeds of order 10 $\mu$m/s, about three times faster than the swarm expansion. The flow is generated by the action of counterclockwise rotating flagella of cells stuck to the substratum, which drives fluid clockwise around isolated cells (when viewed from above), counterclockwise between cells in dilute arrays, and clockwise in front of cells at the swarm edge. The river provides an avenue for long-range communication in the swarming colony, ideally suited for secretory vesicles that diffuse poorly. These findings broaden our understanding of swarming dynamics and have implications for the engineering of bacterial-driven microfluidic devices.},

abstract = {Real-time QPCR based methods for determination of plasmid copy number in recombinant Escherichia coli cultures are presented. Two compatible methods based on absolute and relative analyses were tested with recombinant E. coli DH5$\alpha$ harboring pBR322, which is a common bacterial cloning vector. The separate detection of the plasmid and the host chromosomal DNA was achieved using two separate primer sets, specific for the plasmid $\beta$-lactamase gene (bla) and for the chromosomal d-1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase gene (dxs), respectively. Since both bla and dxs are single-copy genes of pBR322 and E. coli chromosomal DNA, respectively, the plasmid copy number can be determined as the copy ratio of bla to dxs. These methods were successfully applied to determine the plasmid copy number of pBR322 of E. coli host cells. The results of the absolute and relative analyses were identical and highly reproducible with coefficient of variation (CV) values of 2.8-3.9{\%} and 4.7-5.4{\%}, respectively. The results corresponded to the previously reported values of pBR322 copy number within E. coli host cells, 15-20. The methods introduced in this study are convenient to perform and cost-effective compared to the traditionally used Southern blot method. The primer sets designed in this study can be used to determine plasmid copy number of any recombinant E. coli with a plasmid vector having bla gene. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nature uses 64 codons to encode the synthesis of proteins from the genome, and chooses 1 sense codon—out of up to 6 synonyms—to encode each amino acid. Synonymous codon choice has diverse and important roles, and many synonymous substitutions are detrimental. Here we demonstrate that the number of codons used to encode the canonical amino acids can be reduced, through the genome-wide substitution of target codons by defined synonyms. We create a variant of Escherichia coli with a four-megabase synthetic genome through a high-fidelity convergent total synthesis. Our synthetic genome implements a defined recoding and refactoring scheme—with simple corrections at just seven positions—to replace every known occurrence of two sense codons and a stop codon in the genome. Thus, we recode 18,214 codons to create an organism with a 61-codon genome; this organism uses 59 codons to encode the 20 amino acids, and enables the deletion of a previously essential transfer RNA.},

abstract = {Sperm are highly differentiated and the activities that reprogram them for embryonic development during fertilization have historically been considered unique to the oocyte. We here challenge this view and demonstrate that mouse embryos in the mitotic cell cycle can also directly reprogram sperm for full-term development. Developmentally incompetent haploid embryos (parthenogenotes) injected with sperm developed to produce healthy offspring at up to 24{\%} of control rates, depending when in the embryonic cell cycle injection took place. This implies that most of the first embryonic cell cycle can be bypassed in sperm genome reprogramming for full development. Remodelling of histones and genomic 5'-methylcytosine and 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine following embryo injection were distinct from remodelling in fertilization and the resulting 2-cell embryos consistently possessed abnormal transcriptomes. These studies demonstrate plasticity in the reprogramming of terminally differentiated sperm nuclei and suggest that different epigenetic pathways or kinetics can establish totipotency.},

abstract = {The advent of thousands of annotated genomes, detailed metabolic reconstructions and databases within the flourishing field of systems biology necessitates the development of functionally complete computer models of whole cells and cellular systems. Such models would realistically describe fundamental properties of living systems such as growth, division and chromosome replication. This will inevitably bridge bioinformatic technologies with ongoing mathematical modelling efforts and would allow for in silico prediction of important dynamic physiological events. To demonstrate a potential for the anticipated merger of bioinformatic genome-wide data with a whole-cell computer model, the authors present here an updated version of a dynamic model of Escherichia coli, including a module that correctly describes the initiation and control of DNA replication by nucleoprotein DnaA-ATP molecules. Specifically, a rigorous mathematical approach used to explicitly include the genome-wide distribution of DnaA-binding sites on the replicating chromosome into a computer model of a bacterial cell is discussed. A new simple deterministic approximation of the complex stochastic process of DNA replication initiation is also provided. It is shown for the first time that reasonable assumptions about the mechanism of DNA replication initiation can be implemented in a deterministic whole-cell model to make predictions about the timing of chromosome replication. Furthermore, it is proposed that a large increase in the concentration of DnaA-binding boxes will result in a decreased steady-state growth rate in E. coli. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2008.},

We address this problem with an algorithm-driven DNA assembly planning software tool suite called Raven (http://www.ravencad.org/) that produces optimized assembly plans and allows users to apply experimental outcomes to redesign assembly plans interactively. We used Raven to calculate assembly plans for thousands of variants of five types of genetic constructs, as well as hundreds of constructs of variable size and complexity from the literature. Finally, we experimentally validated a subset of these assembly plans by reconstructing four recombinase-based 'genetic counter' constructs and two 'repressilator' constructs. We demonstrate that Raven's solutions are significantly better than unoptimized solutions at small and large scales and that Raven's assembly instructions are experimentally valid.},

abstract = {Alkane-degrading bacteria are ubiquitous in marine environments, but little is known about how alkane degradation is regulated. Here we investigate alkane sensing, chemotaxis, signal transduction, uptake and pathway regulation in Alcanivorax dieselolei. The outer membrane protein OmpS detects the presence of alkanes and triggers the expression of an alkane chemotaxis complex. The coupling protein CheW2 of the chemotaxis complex, which is induced only by long-chain (LC) alkanes, sends signals to trigger the expression of Cyo, which participates in modulating the expression of the negative regulator protein AlmR. This change in turn leads to the expression of ompT1 and almA, which drive the selective uptake and hydroxylation of LC alkanes, respectively. AlmA is confirmed as a hydroxylase of LC alkanes. Additional factors responsible for the metabolism of medium-chain-length alkanes are also identified, including CheW1, OmpT1 and OmpT2. These results provide new insights into alkane metabolism pathways from alkane sensing to degradation.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

Here, we introduce a simple and general approach to rapidly tune gene networks in Escherichia coli using hypermutable simple sequence repeats embedded in the spacer region of the ribosome binding site. By varying repeat length, we generated expression libraries that incrementally and predictably sample gene expression levels over a 1,000-fold range. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by creating a bistable switch library that programmatically samples the expression space to balance the two states of the switch, and we illustrate the need for tuning by showing that the switch's behavior is sensitive to host context. Further, we show that mutation rates of the repeats are controllable in vivo for stability or for targeted mutagenesis--suggesting a new approach to optimizing gene networks via directed evolution. This tuning methodology should accelerate the process of engineering functionally complex gene networks.},

abstract = {Engineered metabolic pathways constructed from enzymes heterologous to the production host often suffer from flux imbalances, as they typically lack the regulatory mechanisms characteristic of natural metabolism. In an attempt to increase the effective concentration of each component of a pathway of interest, we built synthetic protein scaffolds that spatially recruit metabolic enzymes in a designable manner. Scaffolds bearing interaction domains from metazoan signaling proteins specifically accrue pathway enzymes tagged with their cognate peptide ligands. The natural modularity of these domains enabled us to optimize the stoichiometry of three mevalonate biosynthetic enzymes recruited to a synthetic complex and thereby achieve 77-fold improvement in product titer with low enzyme expression and reduced metabolic load. One of the same scaffolds was used to triple the yield of glucaric acid, despite high titers (0.5 g/l) without the synthetic complex. These strategies should prove generalizeable to other metabolic pathways and programmable for fine-tuning pathway flux.},

Shifts from a low to a high growth rate result in a strict succession of events: RNA synthesis is immediately affected and its rate rapidly increases to that characteristic of the new medium; the increase in optical density shows a lag of a few minutes before the new rate is attained; DNA synthesis and cell division, on the other hand, continue at the old rate for appreciable periods of time and then abruptly shift to the new rates. The times at which these shifts take place are, at 37', invariably 20 and 70 min., regardless of the actual growth rates before and after the shift.

abstract = {Producing complex chemicals using synthetic metabolic pathways in microbial hosts can have many advantages over chemical synthesis but is often complicated by deleterious interactions between pathway intermediates and the host cell metabolism. With the maturation of functional genomic analysis, it is now technically feasible to identify modes of toxicity associated with the accumulation of foreign molecules in the engineered bacterium. Previously, Escherichia coli was engineered to produce large quantities of isoprenoids by creating a mevalonate-based isopentenyl pyrophosphate biosynthetic pathway (V. J. J. Martin et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21:796-802, 2003). The engineered E. coli strain produced high levels of isoprenoids, but further optimization led to an imbalance in carbon flux and the accumulation of the pathway intermediate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), which proved to be cytotoxic to E. coli. Using both DNA microarray analysis and targeted metabolite profiling, we have studied E. coli strains inhibited by the intracellular accumulation of HMG-CoA. Our results indicate that HMG-CoA inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis in the microbial host, leading to generalized membrane stress. The cytotoxic effects of HMG-CoA accumulation can be counteracted by the addition of palmitic acid (16:0) and, to a lesser extent, oleic acid (cis-Delta(9)-18:1) in the growth medium. This work demonstrates the utility of using transcriptomic and metabolomic methods to optimize synthetic biological systems.},

abstract = {Genomic DNA is bound by many proteins that could potentially impede elongation of RNA polymerase (RNAP), but the factors determining the magnitude of transcriptional roadblocking in vivo are poorly understood. Through systematic experiments and modeling, we analyse how roadblocking by the lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli cells is controlled by promoter firing rate, the concentration and affinity of the roadblocker protein, the transcription-coupled repair protein Mfd, and promoter-roadblock spacing. Increased readthrough of the roadblock at higher RNAP fluxes requires active dislodgement of LacI by multiple RNAPs. However, this RNAP cooperation effect occurs only for strong promoters because roadblock-paused RNAP is quickly terminated by Mfd. The results are most consistent with a single RNAP also sometimes dislodging LacI, though we cannot exclude the possibility that a single RNAP reads through by waiting for spontaneous LacI dissociation. Reducing the occupancy of the roadblock site by increasing the LacI off-rate (weakening the operator) increased dislodgement strongly, giving a stronger effect on readthrough than decreasing the LacI on-rate (decreasing LacI concentration). Thus, protein binding kinetics can be tuned to maintain site occupation while reducing detrimental roadblocking. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.

But how are the shapes of micron-sized cells determined from the coordinated activities of nanometer-sized proteins? Here, we review general principles that have surfaced through the study of rod-shaped bacterial growth. Imaging approaches have revealed that polymers of the actin homolog MreB play a central role. MreB both senses and changes cell shape, thereby generating a self-organizing feedback system for shape maintenance. At the molecular level, structural and computational studies indicate that MreB filaments exhibit tunable mechanical properties that explain their preference for certain geometries and orientations along the cylindrical cell body. We illustrate the regulatory landscape of rod-shape formation and the connectivity between cell shape, cell growth, and other aspects of cell physiology. These discoveries provide a framework for future investigations into the architecture and construction of microbes. How do microbes maintain their shape? This review takes a closer look at the role played by the actin homolog MreB in controlling rod-shaped bacterial growth.},

It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {Robust oscillations have recently been observed in a synthetic gene network composed of coupled positive and negative feedback loops. Here we use deterministic and stochastic modeling to investigate how a small time delay in such regulatory networks can lead to strongly nonlinear oscillations that can be characterized by "degrade-and-fire" dynamics. We show that the period of the oscillations can be significantly greater than the delay time, provided the circuit components possess strong activation and tight repression. The variability of the period is strongly influenced by fluctuations near the oscillatory minima, when the number of regulatory molecules is small.},

abstract = {Cellular populations in both nature and the laboratory are composed of phenotypically heterogeneous individuals that compete with each other resulting in complex population dynamics. Predicting population growth characteristics based on knowledge of heterogeneous single-cell dynamics remains challenging. By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations of Escherichia coli to double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a “speed limit” for proliferation.},

abstract = {We have developed a powerful experimental framework that combines competitive selection and microarray-based genetic footprinting to comprehensively reveal the genetic basis of bacterial behaviors. Application of this method to Escherichia coli motility identifies 95{\%} of the known flagellar and chemotaxis genes, and reveals three dozen novel loci that, to varying degrees and through diverse mechanisms, affect motility. To probe the network context in which these genes function, we developed a method that uncovers genome-wide epistatic interactions through comprehensive analyses of double-mutant phenotypes. This allows us to place the novel genes within the context of signaling and regulatory networks, including the Rcs phosphorelay pathway and the cyclic di-GMP second-messenger system. This unifying framework enables sensitive and comprehensive genetic characterization of complex behaviors across the microbial biosphere.},

The deterministic chemical kinetic simulation explicitly includes the molecular details of DNA replication, mRNA transcription, protein translation and particle assembly, as well as the competing protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that control the timing and extent of phage production. The simulation reproduces the holistic behavior of M13, closely matching experimentally reported values of the intracellular levels of phage species and the timing of events in the M13 life cycle.

abstract = {For many decades, the wedding of quantitative data with mathematical modeling has been fruitful, leading to important biological insights. Here, we review some of the ongoing efforts to gain insights into problems in microbiology – and, in particular, cell-cycle progression and its regulation – through observation and quantitative analysis of the natural fluctuations in the system. We first illustrate this idea by reviewing a classic example in microbiology – the Luria–Delbr{\"{u}}ck experiment – and discussing how, in that case, useful information was obtained by looking beyond the mean outcome of the experiment, but instead paying attention to the variability between replicates of the experiment. We then switch gears to the contemporary problem of cell cycle progression and discuss in more detail how insights into cell size regulation and, when relevant, coupling between the cell cycle and the circadian clock, can be gained by studying the natural fluctuations in the system and their statistical properties. We end with a more general discussion of how (in this context) the correct level of phenomenological model should be chosen, as well as some of the pitfalls associated with this type of analysis. Throughout this review the emphasis is not on providing details of the experimental setups or technical details of the models used, but rather, in fleshing out the conceptual structure of this particular approach to the problem. For this reason, we choose to illustrate the framework on a rather broad range of problems, and on organisms from all domains of life, to emphasize the commonality of the ideas and analysis used (as well as their differences).},

The resulting evolved Cry1Ac variants bind TnCAD with high affinity (dissociation constant Kd = 11–41 nM), kill TnCAD-expressing insect cells that are not susceptible to wild-type Cry1Ac, and kill Cry1Ac-resistant T. ni insects up to 335-fold more potently than wild-type Cry1Ac.

Here we demonstrate that the class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues, we identified Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity. Catalytically inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding activity, which we leveraged for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells. Our results establish CRISPR-Cas13a as a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian cells and therapeutic development.},

Similar constraints also limit the use of regulators when building synthetic circuits for engineering applications. Here, we mapped the promoter specificities of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) $\sigma$s as well as the specificity of their interaction with anti-$\sigma$s. DNA synthesis was used to build 86 ECF $\sigma$s (two from every subgroup), their promoters, and 62 anti-$\sigma$s identified from the genomes of diverse bacteria. A subset of 20 $\sigma$s and promoters were found to be highly orthogonal to each other. This set can be increased by combining the -35 and -10 binding domains from different subgroups to build chimeras that target sequences unrepresented in any subgroup. The orthogonal $\sigma$s, anti-$\sigma$s, and promoters were used to build synthetic genetic switches in Escherichia coli. This represents a genome-scale resource of the properties of ECF $\sigma$s and a resource for synthetic biology, where this set of well-characterized regulatory parts will enable the construction of sophisticated gene expression programs.{\textcopyright}2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Using a machine-learning approach, we reveal that guide RNAs sharing specific 5-nucleotide seed sequences can produce strong fitness defects or even kill E. coli regardless of the other 15 nucleotides of guide sequence. This effect occurs at high dCas9 concentrations and can be alleviated by tuning the expression of dCas9 while maintaining strong on-target repression. Our results also highlight the fact that off-targets with as little as nine nucleotides of homology to the guide RNA can strongly block gene expression. Altogether this study provides important design rules to safely use dCas9 in E. coli.},

We have determined the crystal structure of PleD from Caulobacter crescentus, a response regulator with a diguanylate cyclase (DGC) domain, in its activated form. The BeF3-modification of its receiver domain causes rearrangement with respect to an adaptor domain, which, in turn, promotes dimer formation, allowing for the efficient encounter of two symmetric catalytic domains. The substrate analog GTP$\alpha$S and two putative cations are bound to the active sites in a manner similar to adenylate cyclases, suggesting an analogous two-metal catalytic mechanism. An allosteric c-di-GMP-binding mode that crosslinks DGC and an adaptor domain had been identified before. Here, a second mode is observed that crosslinks the DGC domains within a PleD dimer. Both modes cause noncompetitive product inhibition by domain immobilization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, experimental characterization of the dynamic processes in vivo is difficult due to the paucity of methods capable of direct measurements. We present a highly sensitive and versatile method enabling direct characterization of the dynamic processes. Our method is based on single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and quantitative analyses of hybridization signals. We hybridized multiple probes labelled with spectrally distinct fluorophores to multiple sub-regions of single mRNAs, and visualized the kinetics of synthesis and degradation of the sub-regions. Quantitative analyses of the data lead to absolute quantification of the lag time of mRNA induction (the time it takes for external signals to activate transcription initiation), transcription initiation rate, transcription elongation speed (i.e. mRNA chain-growth speed), the rate of premature termination of transcripts and degradation rates. Applying our method to three different biological problems, we demonstrated how our method may be applicable to reveal dynamics of mRNA expression that was difficult to study previously. We expect such absolute quantification can greatly facilitate understanding of gene expression and its regulation working at the levels of transcriptional initiation, elongation and degradation.},

abstract = {Conjugation is the main mode of horizontal gene transfer that spreads antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Strategies for inhibiting conjugation may be useful for preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics and preventing the emergence of bacterial strains with multiple resistances. Filamentous bacteriophages were first observed to inhibit conjugation several decades ago. Here we investigate the mechanism of inhibition and find that the primary effect on conjugation is occlusion of the conjugative pilus by phage particles. This interaction is mediated primarily by phage coat protein g3p, and exogenous addition of the soluble fragment of g3p inhibited conjugation at low nanomolar concentrations. Our data are quantitatively consistent with a simple model in which association between the pili and phage particles or g3p prevents transmission of an F plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance. We also observe a decrease in the donor ability of infected cells, which is quantitatively consistent with a reduction in pili elaboration. Since many antibiotic-resistance factors confer susceptibility to phage infection through expression of conjugative pili (the receptor for filamentous phage), these results suggest that phage may be a source of soluble proteins that slow the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in microbiology is how bacterial cells manage to coordinate gene expression with cell growth during adapting to various environmental conditions. Although the cellular responses to changing environments have been extensively studied using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, it remains poorly understood regarding the molecular strategy enabling bacteria to manipulate the global gene expression patterns. The alarmone (p)ppGpp is a key secondary messenger involved in regulating various biochemical and physiological processes of bacterial cells. However, despite of the extensive studies of (p)ppGpp signaling in stringent response during the past 50 years, the connection between (p)ppGpp and exponential growth remains poorly understood. Our recent work demonstrates that (p)ppGpp is strongly involved in regulating cell growth of Escherichia coli through balancing the cellular investment on metabolic proteins and ribosomes, highlighting itself as a magic governor of bacterial global resource allocation. In this mini-review, we briefly summarize some historical perspectives and current progress of the relation between (p)ppGpp and bacterial exponential growth. Two important future directions are also highlighted: the first direction is to elucidate the cellular signal that triggers (p)ppGpp accumulation during poor growth conditions; the second direction is to investigate the relation between (p)ppGpp and exponential growth for bacterial species other than E. coli.},

abstract = {Various bacteria such as the canonical gram negative Escherichia coli or the well-studied gram positive Bacillus subtilis divide symmetrically after they approximately double their volume. Their size at division is not constant, but is typically distributed over a narrow range. Here, we propose an analytically tractable model for cell size control, and calculate the cell size and interdivision time distributions, as well as the correlations between these variables. We suggest ways of extracting the model parameters from experimental data, and show that existing data for E. coli supports partial size control, and a particular explanation: a cell attempts to add a constant volume from the time of initiation of DNA replication to the next initiation event. This hypothesis accounts for the experimentally observed correlations between mother and daughter cells as well as the exponential dependence of size on growth rate. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Microorganisms adapt to frequent environmental changes through population diversification. Previous studies demonstrated phenotypic diversity in a clonal population and its important effects on microbial ecology. However, the dynamic changes of phenotypic composition have rarely been characterized. Also, cellular variations and environmental factors responsible for phenotypic diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we studied phenotypic diversity driven by metabolic heterogeneity. We characterized metabolic activities and growth kinetics of starved Escherichia coli cells subject to nutrient upshift at single-cell resolution. We observed three subpopulations with distinct metabolic activities and growth phenotypes. One subpopulation was metabolically active and immediately grew upon nutrient upshift. One subpopulation was metabolically inactive and non-viable. The other subpopulation was metabolically partially active, and did not grow upon nutrient upshift. The ratio of these subpopulations changed dynamically during starvation. A long-term observation of cells with partial metabolic activities indicated that their metabolism was later spontaneously restored, leading to growth recovery. Further investigations showed that oxidative stress can induce the emergence of a subpopulation with partial metabolic activities. Our findings reveal the emergence of metabolic heterogeneity and associated dynamic changes in phenotypic composition. In addition, the results shed new light on microbial dormancy, which has important implications in microbial ecology and biomedicine.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {When grown in a rich medium on agar, many bacteria elongate, produce more flagella, and swim in a thin film of fluid over the agar surface in swirling packs. Cells that spread in this way are said to swarm. The agar is a solid gel, with pores smaller than the bacteria, so the swarm/agar interface is fixed. Here we show, in experiments with Escherichia coli, that the swarm/air interface also is fixed. We deposited MgO smoke particles on the top surface of an E. coli swarm near its advancing edge, where cells move in a single layer, and then followed the motion of the particles by dark-field microscopy and the motion of the underlying cells by phase-contrast microscopy. Remarkably, the smoke particles remained fixed (diffusing only a few micrometers) while the swarming cells streamed past underneath. The diffusion coefficients of the smoke particles were smaller over the virgin agar ahead of the swarm than over the swarm itself. Changes between these two modes of behavior were evident within 10-20 microm of the swarm edge, indicating an increase in depth of the fluid in advance of the swarm. The only plausible way that the swarm/air interface can be fixed is that it is covered by a surfactant monolayer pinned at its edges. When a swarm is exposed to air, such a monolayer can markedly reduce water loss. When cells invade tissue, the ability to move rapidly between closely opposed fixed surfaces is a useful trait.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {Recently, we found that Alcanivorax bacteria from various marine environments were capable of degrading halogenated alkanes. Genome sequencing of A. dieselolei B-5 revealed two putative haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) genes, which were supposed to be involved in degradation of halogenated compounds. In this report, we confirm for the first time that the Alcanivorax bacterium encodes a truly functional HLD named DadB. An activity assay with 46 halogenated substrates indicated that DadB possesses broad substrate range and has the highest overall activity among the identified HLDs. DadB prefers brominated substrates; chlorinated alkenes; and the C2-C3 substrates, including the persistent pollutants of 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane and 1,2,3-trichloropropane. As DadB displays no detectable activity toward long-chain haloalkanes such as 1-chlorohexadecane and 1-chlorooctadecane, the degradation of them in A. dieselolei B-5 might be attributed to other enzymes. Kinetic constants were determined with 6 substrates. DadB has highest affinity and largest kcat/Km value toward 1,3-dibromopropane (Km = 0.82 mM, kcat/Km = 16.43 mM−1{\textperiodcentered}s−1). DadB aggregates fast in the buffers with pH≤7.0, while keeps stable in monomer form when pH≥7.5. According to homology modeling, DadB has an open active cavity with a large access tunnel, which is supposed important for larger molecules as opposed to C2-C3 substrates. Combined with the results for other HLDs, we deduce that residue I247 plays an important role in substrate selection. These results suggest that DadB and its host, A. dieselolei B-5, are of potential use for biocatalysis and bioremediation applications.},

The NIR pH-sensitive dye used to construct the probe exhibit high spectral sensitivity with pH changes. It has negligible fluorescence above pH 6 but becomes highly fluorescent below pH 5, with a pKa of 4.7. This probe is ideal for imaging acidic cell organelles such as tumor lysosomes or late endosomes. Cell microscopy data demonstrate that binding of the cRGD probe to ABIR facilitated the endocytosis-mediated lysosomal accumulation and subsequent fluorescence enhancement of the NIR pH-activatable dye in tumor cells (MDA-MB- 435 and 4T1/luc). A similar fluorescence enhancement mechanism was observed in vivo, where the tumors were evident within 4 h post injection. Moreover, lung metastases were also visualized in an orthotopic tumor mouse model using this probe, which was further confirmed by histologic analysis. These results demonstrate the potential of using the new integrin-targeted pH-sensitive probe for the detection of primary and metastatic cancer.},

Transcriptome analysis of single prokaryotic cells is a recently developed and powerful tool. Here we describe a procedure that allows amplification of the total transcript of a single prokaryotic cell for in-depth analysis. This is performed by using a laser-capture microdissection instrument for single-cell isolation, followed by reverse transcription via Moloney murine leukemia virus, degradation of chromosomal DNA with McrBC and DpnI restriction enzymes, single-stranded cDNA (ss-cDNA) ligation using T4 polynucleotide kinase and CircLigase, and polymerization of ss-cDNA to double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) by 29 polymerase. This procedure takes ∼5 d, and sufficient amounts of ds-cDNA can be obtained from single-cell RNA template for further microarray analysis.},

These methods generally rely on the insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette followed by removal of the same cassette, resulting in a two-step procedure for genomic manipulations. Here we describe a method and plasmid system that can edit the genome of E. coli without chromosomal markers. This system, known as Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering (no-SCAR), uses $\lambda$-Red to facilitate genomic integration of donor DNA and double stranded DNA cleavage by Cas9 to counterselect against wild-type cells. We show that point mutations, gene deletions, and short sequence insertions were efficiently performed in several genomic loci in a single-step with regards to the chromosome and did not leave behind scar sites. The single-guide RNA encoding plasmid can be easily cured due to its temperature sensitive origin of replication, allowing for iterative chromosomal manipulations of the same strain, as is often required in metabolic engineering. In addition, we demonstrate the ability to efficiently cure the second plasmid in the system by targeting with Cas9, leaving the cells plasmid-free.},

Formaldehyde-fixed, intact cells were hybridized with fluorescently labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Because of the abundance of rRNA in cells, the binding of the fluorescent probes to individual cells is readily visualized. Phylogenetic identification is achieved by the use of oligonucleotides (length 17 to 34 nucleotides) that are complementary to phylogenetic group-specific 16S rRNA sequences. Appropriate probes can be composed of oligonucleotide sequences that distinguish between the primary kingdoms (eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria) and between closely related organisms. The simultaneous use of multiple probes, labeled with different fluorescent dyes, allows the identification of different cell types in the same microscopic field. Quantitative microfluorimetry shows that the amount of an rRNA-specific probe that binds to Escherichia coli varies with the ribosome content and therefore reflects growth rate.},

We developed a simple and powerful approach for performing native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) in human cells that globally maps strand-specific Pol II density at nucleotide resolution. NET-seq exposes a mode of antisense transcription that originates downstream and converges on transcription from the canonical promoter. Convergent transcription is associated with a distinctive chromatin configuration and is characteristic of lower-expressed genes. Integration of NET-seq with genomic footprinting data reveals stereotypic Pol II pausing coincident with transcription factor occupancy. Finally, exons retained in mature transcripts display Pol II pausing signatures that differ markedly from skipped exons, indicating an intrinsic capacity for Pol II to recognize exons with different processing fates. Together, human NET-seq exposes the topography and regulatory complexity of human gene expression.},

Droplets are generated by vortexing a sample in an immiscible oil to create an emulsion. PCR is performed, and droplets in the emulsion are imaged. Droplets with one or more copies of a nucleic acid are identified, and the nucleic acid concentration of the sample is determined. Numerical simulations of droplet distributions were used to estimate measurement error and dynamic range and to examine the effects of the total volume of droplets imaged and the shape of the droplet size distribution on measurement accuracy. The ability of the method to resolve 1.5- and 3-fold differences in concentration was assessed by using simulations of statistical power. The method was validated experimentally; droplet shrinkage and fusion during amplification were also assessed experimentally and showed negligible effects on measured concentration.},

abstract = {Abstract In bacterial cells, inhibition of ribosomes by sublethal concentrations of antibiotics leads to a decrease in growth rate despite an increase in ribosome content. The limitation of ribosomal activity results in an increase in the level of expression from ribosomal promoters; this can deplete the pool of RNA polymerase (RNAP) that is available for the expression of non-ribosomal genes. However, the magnitude of this effect remains to be quantified. Here, we use the change in the activity of constitutive promoters with different affinities for RNAP to quantify the change in the concentration of free RNAP. The data are consistent with a significant decrease in the amount of RNAP available for transcription of both ribosomal and non ribosomal genes. Results obtained with different reporter genes reveal an mRNA length dependence on the amount of full-length translated protein, consistent with the decrease in ribosome processivity affecting more strongly the translation of longer genes. The genes coding for the $\beta$ and $\beta$' subunits of RNAP are amongst the longest genes in the E. coli genome, while the genes coding for ribosomal proteins are among the shortest genes. This can explain the observed decrease in transcription capacity that favors the expression of genes whose promoters have a high affinity for RNAP, such as ribosomal promoters. Importance Exposure of bacteria to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics can lead to bacterial adaptation and survival at higher doses of inhibitors, which in turn can lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The presence of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics targeting translation results in an increase in the amount of ribosomes per cell and a decrease in the cells' growth rate. In this work, we have found that inhibition of ribosome activity can result in a decrease in the amount of free RNA polymerase available for transcription, thus limiting the protein expression rate via a different pathway than what was expected. This result can be explained by our observation that long genes, such as those coding for RNA polymerase subunits, have a higher probability of premature translation termination in the presence of ribosome inhibitors, while expression of short ribosomal genes is affected less, consistent with their increased concentration.},

abstract = {Multicopy plasmids that have been engineered to produce large quantities of a single gratuitous (nonfunctional, non-toxic) protein are often problematic. When fully induced, these engineered constructions produce very sick bacteria. The reasons for this may be found in the physiology of wild-type laboratory strains that have been selected to grow at maximum rates with optimal quantities of their proteins. Such bacteria apparently experience the accumulation of gratuitous proteins as an internal shift down and they respond to this with a starvation response. Unlike the shift down associated with a change of growth media, the production of large quantities of gratuitous protein is not associated with a new pre-programmed steady-state of balanced growth. Consequently, the starvation response continues until the bacteria commit suicide by, among other things, destroying their ribosomes.},

abstract = {In bacterial habitats, the ability to follow spatial gradients of environmental factors that affect growth and survival can be largely advantageous. The bacterial strategy for unidirectional chemotactic movement in gradients of typical attractants or repellents, such as nutrients or toxins, is well understood. Optimal levels of other factors, however, may be found at intermediate points of a gradient and thus require a bidirectional tactic movement towards the optimum. Here we investigate the chemotactic response of Escherichia coli to pH as an example of such bidirectional taxis. We confirm that E. coli uses chemotaxis to avoid both extremes of low and high pH and demonstrate that the sign of the response is inverted from base-seeking to acid-seeking at a well-defined value of pH. Such inversion is enabled by opposing pH sensing by the two major chemoreceptors, Tar and Tsr, such that the relative strength of the response is modulated by adaptive receptor methylation. We further demonstrate that the inversion point of the pH response can be adjusted in response to changes in the cell density.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

abstract = {Many genetically encoded biosensors use F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to dynamically report biomolecular activities. While pairs of cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (FPs) are most commonly used as FRET partner fluorophores, respectively, green and red FPs offer distinct advantages for FRET, such as greater spectral separation, less phototoxicity, and lower autofluorescence. We previously developed the green-red FRET pair Clover and mRuby2, which improves responsiveness in intramolecular FRET reporters with different designs. Here we report the engineering of brighter and more photostable variants, mClover3 and mRuby3. mClover3 improves photostability by 60{\%} and mRuby3 by 200{\%} over the previous generation of fluorophores. Notably, mRuby3 is also 35{\%} brighter than mRuby2, making it both the brightest and most photostable monomeric red FP yet characterized. Furthermore, we developed a standardized methodology for assessing FP performance in mammalian cells as stand-alone markers and as FRET partners. We found that mClover3 or mRuby3 expression in mammalian cells provides the highest fluorescence signals of all jellyfish GFP or coral RFP derivatives, respectively. Finally, using mClover3 and mRuby3, we engineered an improved version of the CaMKII$\alpha$ reporter Camui$\alpha$ with a larger response amplitude.},

abstract = {A combination of fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (“phylogenetic stains”) and flow cytometry was used for a high resolution automated analysis of mixed microbial populations. Fixed cells of bacteria and yeasts were hybridized in suspension with fluorescein- or tetramethylrhodamine-labeled oligonucleotide probes complementary to group-specific regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. Quantifying probe-conferred cell fluorescence by flow cytometry, we could discriminate between target and nontarget cell populations. We critically examined changes of the hybridization conditions, kinetics of the hybridization, and posthybridization treatments. Intermediate probe concentrations, addition of detergent to the hybridization buffer, and a posthybridization washing step were found to increase the signal to noise ratio. We could demonstrate a linear correlation between growth rate and probe-conferred fluorescence of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas cepacia cells. Oligonucleotides labeled with multiple fluorochromes showed elevated levels of non-specific binding and therefore could not be used to lower the detection limits, which still restrict studies with fluorescing rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to well-growing microbial cells. Two probes of different specificities—one labeled with fluorescein, the other with tetramethylrhodamine—could be applied simultaneously for dual color analysis. {\textcopyright} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Surface translocation of cells on plates and adherence to glass and polystyrene surfaces in biofilm assays are further characteristics of the morphotype. This morphotype (rdar) is normally expressed only at low temperature. However, in two unrelated S. typhimurium strains, spontaneous mutants were found forming rdar colonies independent of temperature. Allelic replacement proved a single point mutation in the promoter region of PagfD in each of the two mutants to be responsible for the constitutive phenotype of a multicellular behaviour. Transcription levels of the two divergently transcribed agf operons required for biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae by Northern blot analysis with gene probes for agfA and agfD as well as expression levels of AgfA by Western blotting were compared in the wild type, the constitutive mutants and their respective ompR and rpoS- derivatives. In the wild type the rdar morphotype and expression of thin aggregative fimbriae are restricted to low temperature on plates containing rich medium of low osmolarity, but biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae occurs upon iron starvation at 37 degrees C. In the upregulated mutants biogenesis of thin aggregative fimbriae is only abolished at high osmolarity at 37 degrees C and in the exponential phase in broth culture. Control of expression of thin aggregative fimbriae and rdar morphology takes place at the transcriptional level at the agfD promoter. A functional ompR allele is required, however an rpoS mutation abolishes transcription only in the wild type, but has no influence on expression of thin aggregative fimbriae in the constitutive mutants.},

In order to change the overall codon composition of the messenger pool, we have expressed in E. coli lacZ with the aid of T7 RNA polymerase and, separately, we have expressed a truncated tufB gene (designated $\Delta$tufB) with the aid of E. coli RNA polymerase so that their respective gene products individually accounted for 30{\%} of the total bacterial protein. Unexpectedly, the maximum expression of either test gene has no specific effect on the relative rates of synthesis of the tRNA species that we studied. Instead, we find that there is a cumulative breakdown of rRNAs, which results in a loss of ribosomes and protein synthetic capacity. After either of the test genes is maximally induced, there is a growing fraction of protein synthesis invested in $\beta$-galactosidase or $\Delta$tufB that is matched by a comparable decrease of the fraction of normal protein synthesis. We have also observed enhanced accumulation of two heat shock proteins during overexpression. Finally, after several hours of overexpression of either test protein, the bacteria are no longer viable. These results are relevant to the practical problems of obtaining high expression levels for cloned proteins.},

abstract = {Genetic switches in which the activity of T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) is directly regulated by external signals are obtained with an engineering strategy of splitting the protein into fragments and using regulatory domains to modulate their reconstitutions. Robust switchable systems with excellent dark-off/light-on properties are obtained with the light-activatable VVD domain and its variants as regulatory domains. For the best split position found, working switches exploit either the light-induced interactions between the VVD domains or allosteric effects. The split fragments show high modularity when they are combined with different regulatory domains such as those with chemically inducible interaction, enabling chemically controlled switches. To summarize, the T7 RNA polymerase-based switches are powerful tools to implement light-activated gene expression in different contexts. Moreover, results about the studied split positions and domain organizations may facilitate future engineering studies on this and on related proteins.},

abstract = {For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems. Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed, facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic effects, and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility in a manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.},

abstract = {Custom-made zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) can induce targeted genome modifications with high efficiency in cell types including Drosophila, C. elegans, plants, and humans. A bottleneck in the application of ZFN technology has been the generation of highly specific engineered zinc-finger arrays. Here we describe OPEN (Oligomerized Pool ENgineering), a rapid, publicly available strategy for constructing multifinger arrays, which we show is more effective than the previously published modular assembly method. We used OPEN to construct 37 highly active ZFN pairs which induced targeted alterations with high efficiencies (1{\%}-50{\%}) at 11 different target sites located within three endogenous human genes (VEGF-A, HoxB13, and CFTR), an endogenous plant gene (tobacco SuRA), and a chromosomally integrated EGFP reporter gene. In summary, OPEN provides an "open-source" method for rapidly engineering highly active zinc-finger arrays, thereby enabling broader practice, development, and application of ZFN technology for biological research and gene therapy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Reducing leaky gene expression is critical for improving protein yield of recombinant bacteria and stability of engineered cellular circuits in synthetic biology. Leaky gene expression occurs when a genetic promoter is not fully repressed, leading to unintended protein synthesis in the absence of stimuli. Existing work have devised specific molecular strategies for reducing leaky gene expression of each promoter. In contrast, we describe a repurposed, modular CRISPRi system that attenuates leaky gene expression using a series of single-guide RNAs targeting the PT7/LacO1 promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRISPRi to significantly increase the dynamic range of T7 RNA Polymerase (T7RNAP) promoters. In addition, we demonstrate that the CRISPRi system can be applied to enhance growth of bacteria that suffer from leaky expression of a toxic protein. Our work establishes a new application of CRISPRi in genomic engineering to improve the control of recombinant gene expression. The approach is potentially generalizable to other gene expression system by changing the single-guide RNAs.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome sequencing projects and further systematic functional analyses of complete gene sets are producing an unprecedented mass of molecular information for a wide range of model organisms. This provides us with a detailed account of the cell with which we may begin to build models for simulating intracellular molecular processes to predict the dynamic behaviour of living cells. Previous work in biochemical and genetic simulation has isolated well-characterized pathways for detailed analysis, but methods for building integrative models of the cell that incorporate gene regulation, metabolism and signaling have not been established. We, therefore, were motivated to develop a software environment for building such integrative models based on gene sets, and running simulations to conduct experiments in silico. Results: E-CELL, a modeling and simulation environment for biochemical and genetic processes, has been developed. The E-CELL system allows a user to define functions of proteins, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, regulation of gene expression and other features of cellular metabolism, as a set of reaction rules. E-CELL simulates cell behavior by numerically integrating the differential equations described implicitly in these reaction rules. The user can observe, through a computer display, dynamic changes in concentrations of proteins, protein complexes and other chemical compounds in the cell. Using this software, we constructed a model of a hypothetical cell with only 127 genes sufficient for transcription, translation, energy production and phospholipid synthesis. Most of the genes are taken from Mycoplasma genitalium, the organism having the smallest known chromosome, whose complete 580 kb genome sequence was determined at TIGR in 1995. We discuss future applications of the E-CELL system with special respect to genome engineering. Availability: The E-CELL software is available upon request.

Here we constructed an orthogonal AND gate in Escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from Pseudomonas syringae. The device comprises two co-activating genes hrpR and hrpS controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a $\sigma$(54)-dependent hrpL promoter driving the output. The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate. The circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. The results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts.},

Samples of glass-attached biofilms and plankton were taken from a Robbins device installed in a water distribution system. More than 70{\%} of the surface-associated cells and less than 40{\%} of the planktonic cells visualized by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining bound detectable amounts of rRNA-targeted probes. These findings are an indication for higher average rRNA content and consequently higher physiological activity of the attached microbial cells compared with the free-living cells. All detectable cells hybridized with the bacterial probe, whereas no Archaea and no Eucarya cells could be detected. Simultaneous hybridization with probes specific for the beta and gamma subclasses of Proteobacteria revealed that microcolonies already consisted of mixed populations in early stages with fewer than 50 cells. These observations provide further evidence that the coexistence and interaction of bacteria in drinking water biofilms may be an integral part of their growth and survival strategies.},

The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.},

abstract = {Modularity plays a fundamental role in the prediction of the behavior of a system from the behavior of its components, guaranteeing that the properties of individual components do not change upon interconnection. Just as electrical, hydraulic, and other physical systems often do not display modularity, nor do many biochemical systems, and specifically, genetic networks. Here, we study the effect of interconnections on the input-output dynamic characteristics of transcriptional components, focusing on a property, which we call 'retroactivity', that plays a role analogous to non-zero output impedance in electrical systems. In transcriptional networks, retroactivity is large when the amount of transcription factor is comparable to, or smaller than, the amount of promoter-binding sites, or when the affinity of such binding sites is high. To attenuate the effect of retroactivity, we propose a feedback mechanism inspired by the design of amplifiers in electronics. We introduce, in particular, a mechanism based on a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. This mechanism enjoys a remarkable insulation property, due to the fast timescales of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Temporally precise, noninvasive control of activity in well-defined neuronal populations is a long-sought goal of systems neuroscience. We adapted for this purpose the naturally occurring algal protein Channelrhodopsin-2, a rapidly gated light-sensitive cation channel, by using lentiviral gene delivery in combination with high-speed optical switching to photostimulate mammalian neurons. We demonstrate reliable, millisecond-timescale control of neuronal spiking, as well as control of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. This technology allows the use of light to alter neural processing at the level of single spikes and synaptic events, yielding a widely applicable tool for neuroscientists and biomedical engineers. Neural computation depends on the temporally diverse spiking pat-terns of different classes of neurons that express unique genetic markers and demonstrate heterogeneous wiring properties within neural net-works. Although direct electrical stimulation and recording of neurons in intact brain tissue have provided many insights into the function of circuit subfields (for example, see refs. 1–3), neurons belonging to a specific class are often sparsely embedded within tissue, posing funda-mental challenges for resolving the role of particular neuron types in information processing. A high–temporal resolution, noninvasive, genetically based method to control neural activity would enable elucidation of the temporal activity patterns in specific neurons that drive circuit dynamics, plasticity and behavior. Despite substantial progress made in the analysis of neural network geometry by means of non–cell-type-specific techniques like glutamate uncaging (for example, see refs. 4–7), no tool has yet been invented with the requisite spatiotemporal resolution to probe neural coding at the resolution of single spikes. Furthermore, previous genetically encoded optical methods, although elegant 8–10,11 , have allowed control of neuronal activity over timescales of seconds to minutes, perhaps owing to their mechanisms for effecting depolarization. Kinetics roughly a thousand times faster would enable remote control of 100 mV},

However, the mechanisms responsible for this trait remain to be established. Here we report on the characterization of four alkane hydroxylases from A. dieselolei, including two homologues of AlkB (AlkB1 and AlkB2), a CYP153 homologue (P450), as well as an AlmA-like (AlmA) alkane hydroxylase. Heterologous expression of alkB1, alkB2, p450 and almA in Pseudomonas putida GPo12 (pGEc47$\Delta$B) or P. fluorescens KOB2$\Delta$1 verified their functions in alkane oxidation. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that these genes could be induced by alkanes ranging from C(8) to C(36) . Notably, the expression of the p450 and almA genes was only upregulated in the presence of medium-chain (C(8) -C(16) ) or long-chain (C(22) -C(36) ) n-alkanes, respectively; while alkB1 and alkB2 responded to both medium- and long-chain n-alkanes (C(12) -C(26) ). Moreover, branched alkanes (pristane and phytane) significantly elevated alkB1 and almA expression levels. Our findings demonstrate that the multiple alkane hydroxylase systems ensure the utilization of substrates of a broad chain length range.},

abstract = {The microfluidic mother machine platform has attracted much interest for its potential in studies of bacterial physiology, cellular organization, and cell mechanics. Despite numerous experiments and development of dedicated analysis software, differences in bacterial growth and morphology in narrow mother machine channels compared to typical liquid media conditions have not been systematically characterized. Here we determine changes in E. coli growth rates and cell dimensions in different sized dead-end microfluidic channels using high resolution optical microscopy. We find that E. coli adapt to the confined channel environment by becoming narrower and longer compared to the same strain grown in liquid culture. Cell dimensions decrease as the channel length increases and width decreases. These changes are accompanied by increases in doubling times in agreement with the universal growth law. In channels 100 $\mu$m and longer, cell doublings can completely stop as a result of frictional forces that oppose cell elongation. Before complete cessation of elongation, mechanical stresses lead to substantial deformation of cells and changes in their morphology. Our work shows that mechanical forces rather than nutrient limitation are the main growth limiting factor for bacterial growth in long and narrow channels.},

abstract = {Studies of bacteriophage as therapeutic agents have had mixed and unpredictable outcomes. We argue that interpretation of these apparently paradoxical results requires appreciation of various density-dependent threshold effects. We use a mathematical model to delineate different categories of outcome, including therapy by simple inundation, by active biocontrol, and by delayed active biocontrol. Counter-intuitively, there are situations in which earlier inoculation can be less efficacious, and simultaneous inoculation with antibiotics can be detrimental. Predictions of therapeutic responses are made using formulae dependent on biologically meaningful parameters; experimental measurement of the parameters will be a prerequisite of application of the model to particular study systems. Such modelling can point to which aspects of phage biology might most fruitfully be engineered so as to enhance the viability of bacteriophage therapy. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

Animal migrations are expected to enhance the global spread of pathogens and facilitate cross-species transmission. This does happen, but new research has also shown that migration allows hosts to escape from infected habitats, reduces disease levels when infected animals do not migrate successfully, and may lead to the evolution of less-virulent pathogens. Migratory demands can also reduce immune function, with consequences for host susceptibility and mortality. Studies of pathogen dynamics in migratory species and how these will respond to global change are urgently needed to predict future disease risks for wildlife and humans alike.},

abstract = {This paper shows that for microbial communities, "fences make good neighbors." Communities of soil microorganisms perform critical functions: controlling climate, enhancing crop production, and remediation of environmental contamination. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and the gut are of high biomedical interest. Understanding and harnessing the function of these communities is difficult: artificial microbial communities in the laboratory become unstable because of "winner-takes-all" competition among species. We constructed a community of three different species of wild-type soil bacteria with syntrophic interactions using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication. We found that defined microscale spatial structure is both necessary and sufficient for the stable coexistence of interacting bacterial species in the synthetic community. A mathematical model describes how spatial structure can balance the competition and positive interactions within the community, even when the rates of production and consumption of nutrients by species are mismatched, by exploiting nonlinearities of these processes. These findings provide experimental and modeling evidence for a class of communities that require microscale spatial structure for stability, and these results predict that controlling spatial structure may enable harnessing the function of natural and synthetic multispecies communities in the laboratory.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

The copy number of the target mRNA is estimated from the total intensity of fluorescent foci in the cell, rather than from counting discrete 'spots' as in other currently available protocols. Image analysis is performed using an automated algorithm. The measured mRNA copy number distribution obtained from many individual cells can be used to extract the parameters of stochastic gene activity, namely the frequency and size of transcription bursts from the gene of interest.

However, the mechanisms of such ratio control are poorly understood. Here, we employ experimental and mathematical techniques to understand the combined effects of signal induction and gene expression stochasticity on phenotypic multimodality. We identify two strategies to control phenotypic ratios from an initially homogeneous population, suitable roughly to high-noise and low-noise intracellular environments, and we show that both can be used to generate precise fractional differentiation. In noisy gene expression contexts, such as those found in bacteria, induction within the circuit's bistable region is enough to cause noise-induced bimodality within a feasible time frame. However, in less noisy contexts, such as tightly controlled eukaryotic systems, spontaneous state transitions are rare and hence bimodality needs to be induced with a controlled pulse of induction that falls outside the bistable region. Finally, we show that noise levels, system response time, and ratio tuning accuracy impose trade-offs and limitations on both ratio control strategies, which guide the selection of strategy alternatives.},

abstract = {Microbial populations can maximize fitness in dynamic environments through bet hedging, a process wherein a subpopulation assumes a phenotype not optimally adapted to the present environment but well adapted to an environment likely to be encountered. Here, we show that oxygen induces fluctuating expression of the trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) respiratory system of Escherichia coli, diversifying the cell population and enabling a bet-hedging strategy that permits growth following oxygen loss. This regulation by oxygen affects the variance in gene expression but leaves the mean unchanged. We show that the oxygen-sensitive transcription factor IscR is the key regulator of variability. Oxygen causes IscR to repress expression of a TMAO-responsive signaling system, allowing stochastic effects to have a strong effect on the output of the system and resulting in heterogeneous expression of the TMAO reduction machinery. This work reveals a mechanism through which cells regulate molecular noise to enhance fitness. Environmental oxygen regulates the cell-to-cell variability of an E. coli signal transduction system that controls anaerobic respiration but leaves the population mean unchanged, thereby revealing a distinct form of bet hedging that provides a fitness advantage when oxygen availability rapidly drops.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

abstract = {Background: Molecular competition brings about trade-offs of shared limited resources among the cellular components, and thus introduces a hidden layer of regulatory mechanism by connecting components even without direct physical interactions. Several molecular competition scenarios have been observed recently, but there is still a lack of systematic quantitative understanding to reveal the essence of molecular competition. Methods: Here, by abstracting the analogous competition mechanism behind diverse molecular systems, we built a unified coarse-grained competition motif model to systematically integrate experimental evidences in these processes and analyzed general properties shared behind them from steady-state behavior to dynamic responses. Results: We could predict in what molecular environments competition would reveal threshold behavior or display a negative linear dependence. We quantified how competition can shape regulator-target dose-response curve, modulate dynamic response speed, control target expression noise, and introduce correlated fluctuations between targets. Conclusions: This work uncovered the complexity and generality of molecular competition effect as a hidden layer of gene regulatory network, and therefore provided a unified insight and a theoretical framework to understand and employ competition in both natural and synthetic systems.

abstract = {Bacterial gene expression depends not only on specific regulatory mechanisms, but also on bacterial growth, because important global parameters such as the abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes are all growth-rate dependent. Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The frequent discrepancy between direct microscopic counts and numbers of culturable bacteria from environmental samples is just one of several indications that we currently know only a minor part of the diversity of microorganisms in nature. A combination of direct retrieval of rRNA sequences and whole-cell oligonucleotide probing can be used to detect specific rRNA sequences of uncultured bacteria in natural samples and to microscopically identify individual cells. Studies have been performed with microbial assemblages of various complexities ranging from simple two-component bacterial endosymbiotic associations to multispecies enrichments containing magnetotactic bacteria to highly complex marine and soil communities. Phylogenetic analysis of the retrieved rRNA sequence of an uncultured microorganism reveals its closest culturable relatives and may, together with information on the physicochemical conditions of its natural habitat, facilitate more directed cultivation attempts. For the analysis of complex communities such as multispecies biofilms and activated-sludge flocs, a different approach has proven advantageous. Sets of probes specific to different taxonomic levels are applied consecutively beginning with the more general and ending with the more specific (a hierarchical top-to-bottom approach), thereby generating increasingly precise information on the structure of the community. Not only do rRNA-targeted whole-cell hybridizations yield data on cell morphology, specific cell counts, and in situ distributions of defined phylogenetic groups, but also the strength of the hybridization signal reflects the cellular rRNA content of individual cells. From the signal strength conferred by a specific probe, in situ growth rates and activities of individual cells might be estimated for known species. In many ecosystems, low cellular rRNA content and/or limited cell permeability, combined with background fluorescence, hinders in situ identification of autochthonous populations. Approaches to circumvent these problems are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Tight coordination between transcription and translation is crucial to maintaining the integrity of gene expression in bacteria, yet how bacteria manage to coordinate these two processes remains unclear. Possible direct physical coupling between the RNA polymerase and ribosome has been thoroughly investigated in recent years. Here, we quantitatively characterize the transcriptional kinetics of Escherichia coli under different growth conditions. Transcriptional and translational elongation remain coordinated under various nutrient conditions, as previously reported. However, transcriptional elongation was not affected under antibiotics that slowed down translational elongation. This result was also found by introducing nonsense mutation that completely dissociated transcription from translation. Our data thus provide direct evidence that translation is not required to maintain the speed of transcriptional elongation. In cases where transcription and translation are dissociated, our study provides quantitative characterization of the resulting process of premature transcriptional termination (PTT). PTT-mediated polarity caused by translation-targeting antibiotics substantially affected the coordinated expression of genes in several long operons, contributing to the key physiological effects of these antibiotics. Our results also suggest a model in which the coordination between transcriptional and translational elongation under normal growth conditions is implemented by guanosine tetraphosphate.},

abstract = {Introduction of synthetic circuits into microbes creates competition between circuit and host genes for shared cellular resources, such as ribosomes. This can lead to the emergence of unwanted coupling between the expression of different circuit genes, complicating the design process and potentially leading to circuit failure. By expressing a synthetic 16S rRNA with altered specificity, we can partition the ribosome pool into host-specific and circuit-specific activities. We show mathematically and experimentally that the effects of resource competition can be alleviated by targeting genes to different ribosomal pools. This division of labour can be used to increase flux through a metabolic pathway. We develop a model of cell physiology which is able to capture these observations and use it to design a dynamic resource allocation controller. When implemented, this controller acts to decouple genes by increasing orthogonal ribosome production as the demand for translational resources by a synthetic circuit increases.},

A protease emerging from ∼2500 generations of PACE contains 20 non-silent mutations, cleaves human IL-23 at the target peptide bond, and when pre-mixed with IL-23 in primary cultures of murine splenocytes inhibits IL-23-mediated immune signaling. We characterize the substrate specificity of this evolved enzyme, revealing shifted and broadened specificity changes at the six positions in which the target amino acid sequence differed. Mutational dissection and additional protease specificity profiling reveal the molecular basis of some of these changes. This work establishes the capability of changing the substrate specificity of a protease at many positions in a practical time scale and provides a foundation for the development of custom proteases that catalytically alter or destroy target proteins for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.},

The strength of the 104 PUTRs varied from 0.007{\%} to 4630{\%} of that of the PBAD promoter in the transcriptional level and from 0.1{\%} to 137{\%} in the translational level.

abstract = {Since the first schematic illustrations of dividing cells, we have come a long way in characterising eukaryotic cells and defining their cell-cycle status thanks to a number of complementary approaches. Although most of these approaches rely on cell-fixation procedures to identify molecular components in cell lysates, cultured cells or tissues, the development of GFP technology has enabled visualisation of virtually any fusion protein in cellulo and in vivo, and the exploitation of functional elements with well-defined spatiotemporal characteristics has enabled the development of genetically encoded fluorescent markers of cell-cycle phases, thus providing novel means of characterising the status of living cells in real time with high resolution. Together with technological advances in fluorescence chemistry and imaging approaches, the more recent development of fluorescent biosensors has provided direct means of probing cell-cycle regulators and of studying their dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we review classical approaches that rely on cell fixation to characterise the cell-cycle status and its regulatory enzymes, and we describe the more recent development of cell-cycle markers based on genetically encoded fusions of fluorescent proteins with characteristic cell-cycle features, and of fluorescent biosensor technology to probe cell-cycle regulators in living cells. Biosensors not only provide a means of characterising the behaviour of cell-cycle regulators in their natural environment, they are also very useful for comparative studies of biological processes in healthy and pathological conditions, and can be further applied to diagnostic approaches to assess the status of a specific target, and to monitor response to therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Accurate characterization of promoter behavior is essential for the rational design of functional synthetic transcription networks such as logic gates and oscillators. However, transcription rates observed from promoters can vary significantly depending on the growth rate of host cells and the experimental and genetic context of measurement. Further, in vivo measurement methods must accommodate variation in translation, protein folding and maturation rates of reporter proteins, as well as metabolic load. The external factors affecting transcription activity may be considered extrinsic, and the goal of characterization should be to obtain quantitative measures of the intrinsic characteristics of promoters. We have developed a promoter characterization method that is based on a mathematical model for cell growth and reporter gene expression and exploits multiple in vivo measurements to compensate for variation due to extrinsic factors. First, we used optical density and fluorescent reporter gene measurements to account for the effect of differing cell growth rates. Second, we compared the output of reporter genes to that of a control promoter using concurrent dual-channel fluorescence measurements. This allowed us to derive a quantitative promoter characteristic ($\rho$) that provides a robust measure of the intrinsic properties of a promoter, relative to the control. We imposed different extrinsic factors on growing cells, altering carbon source and adding bacteriostatic agents and demonstrated that the use of $\rho$ values reduced the fraction of variance due to extrinsic factors from 78{\%} to less than 4{\%}. This is a simple and reliable method for quantitative description of promoter properties.},

These occur as transient changes in, for example, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The intensity and duration of these perturbations differ between cells in a population. The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.},

abstract = {The field of microbiology has traditionally been concerned with and focused on studies at the population level. Information on how cells respond to their environment, interact with each other, or undergo complex processes such as cellular differentiation or gene expression has been obtained mostly by inference from population-level data. Individual microorganisms, even those in supposedly "clonal" populations, may differ widely from each other in terms of their genetic composition, physiology, biochemistry, or behavior. This genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity has important practical consequences for a number of human interests, including antibiotic or biocide resistance, the productivity and stability of industrial fermentations, the efficacy of food preservatives, and the potential of pathogens to cause disease. New appreciation of the importance of cellular heterogeneity, coupled with recent advances in technology, has driven the development of new tools and techniques for the study of individual microbial cells. Because observations made at the single-cell level are not subject to the "averaging" effects characteristic of bulk-phase, population-level methods, they offer the unique capacity to observe discrete microbiological phenomena unavailable using traditional approaches. As a result, scientists have been able to characterize microorganisms, their activities, and their interactions at unprecedented levels of detail.},

Here we present a versatile engineering platform for yeast, which contains both a rapid, modular assembly method and a basic set of characterized parts. This platform provides a framework in which to create new designs, as well as data on promoters, terminators, degradation tags, and copy number to inform those designs. Additionally, we describe genome-editing tools for making modifications directly to the yeast chromosomes, which we find preferable to plasmids due to reduced variability in expression. With this toolkit, we strive to simplify the process of engineering yeast by standardizing the physical manipulations and suggesting best practices that together will enable more straightforward translation of materials and data from one group to another. Additionally, by relieving researchers of the burden of technical details, they can focus on higher-level aspects of experimental design.},

Some cannabinoids, the hallmark constituents of Cannabis, and their analogues have been investigated extensively for their potential medical applications2. Certain cannabinoid formulations have been approved as prescription drugs in several countries for the treatment of a range of human ailments3. However, the study and medicinal use of cannabinoids has been hampered by the legal scheduling of Cannabis, the low in planta abundances of nearly all of the dozens of known cannabinoids4, and their structural complexity, which limits bulk chemical synthesis. Here we report the complete biosynthesis of the major cannabinoids cannabigerolic acid, $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, cannabidiolic acid, $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabivarinic acid and cannabidivarinic acid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, from the simple sugar galactose. To accomplish this, we engineered the native mevalonate pathway to provide a high flux of geranyl pyrophosphate and introduced a heterologous, multi-organism-derived hexanoyl-CoA biosynthetic pathway5. We also introduced the Cannabis genes that encode the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of olivetolic acid6, as well as the gene for a previously undiscovered enzyme with geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase activity and the genes for corresponding cannabinoid synthases7,8. Furthermore, we established a biosynthetic approach that harnessed the promiscuity of several pathway genes to produce cannabinoid analogues. Feeding different fatty acids to our engineered strains yielded cannabinoid analogues with modifications in the part of the molecule that is known to alter receptor binding affinity and potency9. We also demonstrated that our biological system could be complemented by simple synthetic chemistry to further expand the accessible chemical space. Our work presents a platform for the production of natural and unnatural cannabinoids that will allow for more rigorous study of these compounds and could be used in the development of treatments for a variety of human health problems.},

abstract = {Bordetella bacteriophages generate diversity in a gene that specifies host tropism. This microevolutionary adaptation is produced by a genetic element that combines the basic retroelement life cycle of transcription, reverse transcription and integration with site-directed, adenine-specific mutagenesis. Central to this process is a reverse transcriptase-mediated exchange between two repeats; one serving as a donor template (TR) and the other as a recipient of variable sequence information (VR). Here we describe the genetic basis for diversity generation. The directionality of information transfer is determined by a 21-base-pair sequence present at the 3' end of VR. On the basis of patterns of marker transfer in response to variant selective pressures, we propose that a TR reverse transcript is mutagenized, integrated into VR as a single non-coding strand, and then partially converted to the parental VR sequence. This allows the diversity-generating system to minimize variability to the subset of bases under selection. Using the Bordetella phage cassette as a signature, we have identified numerous related elements in diverse bacteria. These elements constitute a new family of retroelements with the potential to confer selective advantages to their host genomes.},

Initial PCRs generate overlapping gene segments that are then used as template DNA for another PCR to create a full-length product. Internal primers generate overlapping, complementary 3' ends on the intermediate segments and introduce nucleotide substitutions, insertions or deletions for site-directed mutagenesis, or for gene splicing, encode the nucleotides found at the junction of adjoining gene segments. Overlapping strands of these intermediate products hybridize at this 3' region in a subsequent PCR and are extended to generate the full-length product amplified by flanking primers that can include restriction enzyme sites for inserting the product into an expression vector for cloning purposes. The highly efficient generation of mutant or chimeric genes by this method can easily be accomplished with standard laboratory reagents in approximately 1 week.},

This allowed direct observation of stochastic firing of DNA replication origins, which differs from cell to cell. We also show that the predominant cytosine-to-thymine mutations observed in single-cell genomics often arise from the artifact of cytosine deamination upon cell lysis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli cells is a complex process, where among other parameters, plasmid copy number, structural and segregational stability of plasmid have an important impact on the success of productivity. It was recognised that a method for accurate and rapid quantification of plasmid copy number is necessary for optimization and better understanding of this process. Lately, qPCR is becoming the method of choice for this purpose. In the presented work, an improved qPCR method adopted for PCN determination in various fermentation processes was developed. RESULTS To avoid experimental errors arising from irreproducible DNA isolation, whole cells, treated by heating at 95 degrees C for 10 minutes prior to storage at -20 degrees C, were used as a template source. Relative quantification, taking into account different amplification efficiencies of amplicons for chromosome and plasmid, was used in the PCN calculation. The best reproducibility was achieved when the efficiency estimated for specific amplicon, obtained within one run, was averaged. It was demonstrated that the quantification range of 2 log units (100 to 10000 bacteria per well) enable quantification in each time point during fermentation. The method was applied to study PCN variation in fermentation at 25 degrees C and the correlation between PCN and protein accumulation was established. CONCLUSION Using whole cells as a template source and relative quantification considering different PCR amplification efficiencies are significant improvements of the qPCR method for PCN determination. Due to the approaches used, the method is suitable for PCN determination in fermentation processes using various media and conditions.},

GFPs fluoresce in vivo upon receiving energy from either a luciferase-oxyluciferin excited-state complex or a Ca2+-activated photoprotein. These highly fluorescent proteins are unique due to the chemical nature of their chromophore, which is comprised of modified amino acid (aa) residues within the polypeptide. This report describes the cloning and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic clones of GFP from the cnidarian, Aequorea victoria. The gfp10 cDNA encodes a 238-aa-residue polypeptide with a calculated Mr of 26888. Comparsion of A. victoria GFP genomic clones shows three different restriction enzyme patterns which suggests that at least three different genes are present in the A. victoria population at Friday Harbor, Washington. The gfp gene encoded by the $\lambda$GFP2 genomic clone is comprised of at least three exons spread over 2.6 kb. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and the gene will aid in the elucidation of structure-function relationships in this unique class of proteins. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

@article{Kelly2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The engineering of many-component, synthetic biological systems is being made easier by the development of collections of reusable, standard biological parts. However, the complexity of biology makes it difficult to predict the extent to which such efforts will succeed. As a first practical example, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts started at MIT now maintains and distributes thousands of BioBrick standard biological parts. However, BioBrick parts are only standardized in terms of how individual parts are physically assembled into multi-component systems, and most parts remain uncharacterized. Standardized tools, techniques, and units of measurement are needed to facilitate the characterization and reuse of parts by independent researchers across many laboratories. RESULTS: We found that the absolute activity of BioBrick promoters varies across experimental conditions and measurement instruments. We choose one promoter (BBa{\_}J23101) to serve as an in vivo reference standard for promoter activity. We demonstrated that, by measuring the activity of promoters relative to BBa{\_}J23101, we could reduce variation in reported promoter activity due to differences in test conditions and measurement instruments by approximately 50{\%}. We defined a Relative Promoter Unit (RPU) in order to report promoter characterization data in compatible units and developed a measurement kit so that researchers might more easily adopt RPU as a standard unit for reporting promoter activity. We distributed a set of test promoters to multiple labs and found good agreement in the reported relative activities of promoters so measured. We also characterized the relative activities of a reference collection of BioBrick promoters in order to further support adoption of RPU-based measurement standards. CONCLUSION: Relative activity measurements based on an in vivoreference standard enables improved measurement of promoter activity given variation in measurement conditions and instruments. These improvements are sufficient to begin to support the measurement of promoter activities across many laboratories. Additional in vivo reference standards for other types of biological functions would seem likely to have similar utility, and could thus improve research on the design, production, and reuse of standard biological parts.},

abstract = {Bacterial physiology is a branch of biology that aims to understand overarching principles of cellular reproduction. Many important issues in bacterial physiology are inherently quantitative, and major contributors to the field have often brought together tools and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. This article presents a comprehensive overview of major ideas and approaches developed since the early 20th century for anyone who is interested in the fundamental problems in bacterial physiology. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part (sections 1-3), we review the first 'golden era' of bacterial physiology from the 1940s to early 1970s and provide a complete list of major references from that period. In the second part (sections 4-7), we explain how the pioneering work from the first golden era has influenced various rediscoveries of general quantitative principles and significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically, section 4 presents the history and current progress of the 'adder' principle of cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarse-graining the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome 'sectors' re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final section 8, we conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.},

Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts), and across all circuits 92{\%} of the output states functioned as predicted.

abstract = {Assembly of DNA parts into DNA constructs is a foundational technology in the emerging field of synthetic biology. An efficient DNA assembly method is particularly important for high-throughput, automated DNA assembly in biofabrication facilities and therefore we investigated one-step, scarless DNA assembly via ligase cycling reaction (LCR). LCR assembly uses single-stranded bridging oligos complementary to the ends of neighboring DNA parts, a thermostable ligase to join DNA backbones, and multiple denaturation-annealing-ligation temperature cycles to assemble complex DNA constructs. The efficiency of LCR assembly was improved ca. 4-fold using designed optimization experiments and response surface methodology. Under these optimized conditions, LCR enabled one-step assembly of up to 20 DNA parts and up to 20 kb DNA constructs with very few single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({\textless}1 per 25 kb) and insertions/deletions ({\textless}1 per 50 kb). Experimental comparison of various sequence-independent DNA assembly methods showed that circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC) and Gibson isothermal assembly did not enable assembly of more than four DNA parts with more than 50{\%} of clones being correct. Yeast homologous recombination and LCR both enabled reliable assembly of up to 12 DNA parts with 60-100{\%} of individual clones being correct, but LCR assembly provides a much faster and easier workflow than yeast homologous recombination. LCR combines reliable assembly of many DNA parts via a cheap, rapid, and convenient workflow and thereby outperforms existing DNA assembly methods. LCR assembly is expected to become the method of choice for both manual and automated high-throughput assembly of DNA parts into DNA constructs.},

Improved transposon mutagenesis methods revealed a class of quasi-essential genes that are needed for robust growth, explaining the failure of our initial design. Three cycles of design, synthesis, and testing, with retention of quasi-essential genes, produced JCVI-syn3.0 (531 kilobase pairs, 473 genes), which has a genome smaller than that of any autonomously replicating cell found in nature. JCVI-syn3.0 retains almost all genes involved in the synthesis and processing of macromolecules. Unexpectedly, it also contains 149 genes with unknown biological functions. JCVI-syn3.0 is a versatile platform for investigating the core functions of life and for exploring whole-genome design.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the challenge of maximizing an unknown function f for which evaluations are noisy and are acquired with high cost. An iterative procedure uses the previous measures to actively select the next estimation of f which is predicted to be the most useful. We focus on the case where the function can be evaluated in parallel with batches of fixed size and analyze the benefit compared to the purely sequential procedure in terms of cumulative regret. We introduce the Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound and Pure Exploration algorithm (GP-UCB-PE) which combines the UCB strategy and Pure Exploration in the same batch of evaluations along the parallel iterations. We prove theoretical upper bounds on the regret with batches of size K for this procedure which show the improvement of the order of sqrt{\{}K{\}} for fixed iteration cost over purely sequential versions. Moreover, the multiplicative constants involved have the property of being dimension-free. We also confirm empirically the efficiency of GP-UCB-PE on real and synthetic problems compared to state-of-the-art competitors.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

In this study, novel derivatives of indoline and morpholine were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxic effects on osteosarcoma and Human Embryonic Kidney cells. To characterize cytotoxicity and the mechanism of cell death, we used cytotoxicity, migration, apoptosis markers and mitochondrial calcium assays. Among the compounds tested, the indoline derivatives, generally, produced a higher cytotoxic effect compared to the morpholine derivatives, in osteosarcoma cells. Specifically, new indoline derivative N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl(4′-methylphenyl)methyl)indoline exhibited effective cytotoxic activity, with an IC50 of ∼74 $\mu$M. The same molecule induced cell death by apoptosis and inhibited migration of the cells. Further, analysis of mitochondrial calcium levels revealed the existence of calcium dependent cell death mechanisms in different cell types. Therefore, N-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl(4′-methylphenyl)methyl)indoline can be considered as a potential drug-lead compound towards the discovery of new anti-cancer agents.},

abstract = {Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying gene expression heterogeneity in populations of cells. Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a microfluidic platform for single-cell wholetranscriptome analysis. In this approach, single cells are captured and lysed in a microfluidic device, where mRNAs with poly(A) tails are reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA is then collected and sequenced using a next generation sequencing platform. We prepared 94 libraries consisting of single mouse embryonic cells and technical replicates of extracted RNA and thoroughly characterized the performance of this technology. Microfluidic implementation increased mRNA detection sensitivity as well as improved measurement precision compared with tube-based protocols. With 0.2Mreads per cell, we were able to reconstruct amajority of the bulk transcriptome with 10 single cells. We also quantified variation between and within different types of mouse embryonic cells and found that enhanced measurement precision, detection sensitivity, and experimental throughput aided the distinction between biological variability and technical noise. With this work, we validated the advantages of an early approach to single-cell RNA-Seq and showed that the benefits of combining microfluidic technology with high-throughput sequencing will be valuable for large-scale efforts in single-cell transcriptome analysis.},

It has proved to be very powerful, and many exciting new biological discoveries have been achieved in the last decade. Its application has greatly improved our understanding of diverse biological processes and the underlying molecular mechanisms, an understanding that would not have been achievable by conventional analysis based on bulk populations. However, so far, single-cell RNA-seq analysis has been used mostly for higher organisms. For microorganisms, single-cell RNA-seq has not been widely used, mainly because the stiff cell wall prevents effective lysis, much less starting RNA material is obtained, and the RNA lacks polyadenylated tails for universal priming of mRNA molecules. In general, the detection efficiency of current single-cell RNA-seq technologies is very low, and further development or improvement of these technologies is required for exploring the microbial world at single-cell resolution. Here, we briefly review recent developments in single-cell RNA-seq of microorganisms and discuss current challenges and future directions.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteriochromes are a newly recognized group of photoreceptors that are distinct relatives of phytochromes but are found only in cyanobacteria. A putative cyanobacteriochrome, CcaS, is known to chromatically regulate the expression of the phycobilisome linker gene (cpcG2) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this study, we isolated the chromophore-binding domain of CcaS from Synechocystis as well as from phycocyanobilin-producing Escherichia coli. Both preparations showed the same reversible photoconversion between a green-absorbing form (Pg, lambda(max) = 535 nm) and a red-absorbing form (Pr, lambda(max) = 672 nm). Mass spectrometry and denaturation analyses suggested that Pg and Pr bind phycocyanobilin in a double-bond configuration of C15-Z and C15-E, respectively. Autophosphorylation activity of the histidine kinase domain in nearly full-length CcaS was up-regulated by preirradiation with green light. Similarly, phosphotransfer to the cognate response regulator, CcaR, was higher in Pr than in Pg. From these results, we conclude that CcaS phosphorylates CcaR under green light and induces expression of cpcG2, leading to accumulation of CpcG2-phycobilisome as a chromatic acclimation system. CcaS is the first recognized green light receptor in the expanded phytochrome superfamily, which includes phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes.},

Many of these applications utilize two or more exogenous promoters, imposing a currently unquantifiable metabolic burden on the living system. Here, we engineered a collection of inducible promoters (regulated by LacI-based transcription factors) that maximize the free-state of endogenous RNA polymerase (RNAP). We leveraged this collection of inducible promotors to construct simple two-channel logical controls that enabled us to measure metabolic burden – as it relates to RNAP resource partitioning. The two-channel genetic circuits utilized sets of signal-coupled transcription factors that regulate cognate inducible promoters in a coordinated logical fashion. With this fundamental genetic architecture, we evaluated the performance of each inducible promoter as discrete operations, and as coupled systems to evaluate and quantify the effects of resource partitioning. Obtaining the ability to systematically and accurately measure the apparent RNA-polymerase resource budget will enable researchers to design more robust genetic circuits, with significantly higher fidelity. Moreover, this study presents a workflow that can be used to better understand how living systems adapt RNAP resources, via the complementary pairing of constitutive and regulated promoters that vary in strength.}},

While we can reliably measure gene expression changes, we still understand relatively little why expression changes the way it does. How does a coordinated response emerge in such complex networks and how many input signals are necessary to achieve it? Here, we unravel the regulatory program of gene expression in Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism with more than 30 known transcription factors. Using a library of fluorescent transcriptional reporters, we comprehensively quantify the activity of central metabolic promoters in 26 environmental conditions. The expression patterns were dominated by growth rate-dependent global regulation for most central metabolic promoters in concert with highly condition-specific activation for only few promoters. Using an approximate mathematical description of promoter activity, we dissect the contribution of global and specific transcriptional regulation. About 70\% of the total variance in promoter activity across conditions was explained by global transcriptional regulation. Correlating the remaining specific transcriptional regulation of each promoter with the cell's metabolome response across the same conditions identified potential regulatory metabolites. Remarkably, cyclic AMP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose-1-phosphate alone explained most of the specific transcriptional regulation through their interaction with the two major transcription factors Crp and Cra. Thus, a surprisingly simple regulatory program that relies on global transcriptional regulation and input from few intracellular metabolites appears to be sufficient to coordinate E. coli central metabolism and explain about 90\% of the experimentally observed transcription changes in 100 genes.}},

By illustrating the information transfer and flux adaptation for key regulatory circuits inEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilisand yeast, they conclude that cells rely on a few conserved metabolites to report on their global metabolic status and mount appropriate responses. Beyond fuelling cellular activities with building blocks and energy, metabolism also integrates environmental conditions into intracellular signals. The underlying regulatory network is complex and multifaceted: it ranges from slow interactions, such as changing gene expression, to rapid ones, such as the modulation of protein activity via post-translational modification or the allosteric binding of small molecules. In this Review, we outline the coordination of common metabolic tasks, including nutrient uptake, central metabolism, the generation of energy, the supply of amino acids and protein synthesis. Increasingly, a set of key metabolites is recognized to control individual regulatory circuits, which carry out specific functions of information input and regulatory output.

Together with ribosome profiling, all 54 genetic parts (promoters, ribozymes, RBSs, terminators) are parameterized and used to inform a mathematical model that can predict circuit performance, dynamics, and robustness. The circuit behaves as designed; however, it is riddled with genetic errors, including cryptic sense/antisense promoters and translation, attenuation, incorrect start codons, and a failed gate. While not impacting the expected Boolean logic, they reduce the prediction accuracy and could lead to failures when the parts are used in other designs. Finally, the cellular power (RNAP and ribosome usage) required to maintain a circuit state is calculated. This work demonstrates the use of a small number of measurements to fully parameterize a regulatory circuit and quantify its impact on host.

It is unclear, however, what ultimately determines growth rates in different environmental conditions. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that other objectives are also important3–7, such as the rate of physiological adaptation to changing environments8,9. A common challenge for cells is that these objectives cannot be independently optimized, and maximizing one often reduces another. Many such trade-offs have indeed been hypothesized on the basis of qualitative correlative studies8–11. Here we report a trade-off between steady-state growth rate and physiological adaptability in Escherichia coli, observed when a growing culture is abruptly shifted from a preferred carbon source such as glucose to fermentation products such as acetate. These metabolic transitions, common for enteric bacteria, are often accompanied by multi-hour lags before growth resumes. Metabolomic analysis reveals that long lags result from the depletion of key metabolites that follows the sudden reversal in the central carbon flux owing to the imposed nutrient shifts. A model of sequential flux limitation not only explains the observed trade-off between growth and adaptability, but also allows quantitative predictions regarding the universal occurrence of such tradeoffs, based on the opposing enzyme requirements of glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis. We validate these predictions experimentally for many different nutrient shifts in E. coli, as well as for other respiro-fermentative microorganisms, including Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

abstract = {{Transcription networks consist of hundreds of transcription factors with thousands of often overlapping target genes. While we can reliably measure gene expression changes, we still understand relatively little why expression changes the way it does. How does a coordinated response emerge in such complex networks and how many input signals are necessary to achieve it? Here, we unravel the regulatory program of gene expression in Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism with more than 30 known transcription factors. Using a library of fluorescent transcriptional reporters, we comprehensively quantify the activity of central metabolic promoters in 26 environmental conditions. The expression patterns were dominated by growth rate-dependent global regulation for most central metabolic promoters in concert with highly condition-specific activation for only few promoters. Using an approximate mathematical description of promoter activity, we dissect the contribution of global and specific transcriptional regulation. About 70\% of the total variance in promoter activity across conditions was explained by global transcriptional regulation. Correlating the remaining specific transcriptional regulation of each promoter with the cell's metabolome response across the same conditions identified potential regulatory metabolites. Remarkably, cyclic AMP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose-1-phosphate alone explained most of the specific transcriptional regulation through their interaction with the two major transcription factors Crp and Cra. Thus, a surprisingly simple regulatory program that relies on global transcriptional regulation and input from few intracellular metabolites appears to be sufficient to coordinate E. coli central metabolism and explain about 90\% of the experimentally observed transcription changes in 100 genes.}},

abstract = {{Multiple phenotypic states often arise in a single cell with different gene-expression states that undergo transcription regulation with positive feedback. Recent experiments show that, at least in E. coli, the gene state switching can be neither extremely slow nor exceedingly rapid as many previous theoretical treatments assumed. Rather, it is in the intermediate region which is difficult to handle mathematically. Under this condition, from a full chemical-master-equation description we derive a model in which the protein copy number, for a given gene state, follows a deterministic mean-field description while the protein-synthesis rates fluctuate due to stochastic gene state switching. The simplified kinetics yields a nonequilibrium landscape function, which, similar to the energy function for equilibrium fluctuation, provides the leading orders of fluctuations around each phenotypic state, as well as the transition rates between the two phenotypic states. This rate formula is analogous to Kramers’ theory for chemical reactions. The resulting behaviors are significantly different from the two limiting cases studied previously.}},
